# Architecture Overview

## System Layers

The system is organized in four layers, from top to bottom:

### 1. Interface Layer
- **CLI** — subcommand-based interface (`dam import`, `dam search`, `dam relocate`, etc.)

### 2. Core Library
- **Asset Service** — orchestrates import, grouping, relocation, verification, deduplication. Main business logic.
- **Content Store** — SHA-256 hashing, deduplication, mapping hash → physical location(s). A file *is* its hash.
- **Metadata Store** — text-based sidecar files (YAML). Stores tags, descriptions, variant groupings, processing recipes. Human-readable and diffable.
- **Device Registry** — tracks volumes, mount points, online/offline status. Allows referencing files on unmounted media.
- **Query Engine** — searches the local catalog by metadata fields, dates, tags, file types, etc.
- **Preview Generator** — creates thumbnails/previews using external tools (dcraw/libraw, ffmpeg). Caches in local catalog.
- **Format Module** — template engine for flexible CLI output (presets, custom templates, JSON serialization).

### 3. Storage Layer
- **Local Catalog** — always available on local disk. Contains asset index, cached metadata, thumbnails, volume registry. Small compared to originals.
- **Media Volumes** — external/offline drives holding the actual asset files. May be unmounted.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Content-addressable storage**: originals are immutable and identified by SHA-256 hash.
- **Text-based metadata**: sidecar files (YAML) are the source of truth for all metadata.
- **SQLite as local catalog**: fast queries, single file, no server. Acts as cache/index over the authoritative sidecar files.
- **Offline-capable**: the local catalog holds enough information (index + thumbnails) to browse and search without media being mounted.
- **Duplicate location tracking**: when the same content (same SHA-256) is found at a new file path, the location is added to the existing variant rather than being silently skipped. This preserves knowledge of all physical copies, enables the `duplicates` command, and supports future cleanup/consolidation workflows.
- **Stem-based auto-grouping**: files sharing the same filename stem in the same directory are grouped into one asset during import (e.g. `DSC_4521.NEF` + `DSC_4521.jpg` + `DSC_4521.xmp`). Media files become variants; processing sidecars (XMP, COS, etc.) are attached as recipes. No timestamp matching is required — directory co-location and stem identity are sufficient.
- **Location-based recipe identity**: recipes are identified by their location `(volume_id, relative_path)` rather than content hash, because recipe files are routinely edited by external software. Re-importing or verifying a modified recipe updates it in place rather than creating duplicates or reporting failures.
- **Scriptable output**: all commands support `--json` for machine-readable output. Listing commands (`search`, `duplicates`) additionally support `--format` with presets and custom templates for flexible pipeline integration.

## Technology

- **Language**: Rust
- **Platforms**: macOS, Linux
- **Key crates**: clap (CLI), sha2 (hashing), serde (serialization), rusqlite (SQLite), kamadak-exif (EXIF parsing), quick-xml (XMP parsing), image (preview generation), uuid (asset identity)
- **External tools**: dcraw/libraw (RAW previews), ffmpeg (video thumbnails)
