# Proposal: Photo Workflow Tool Integration

## Motivation

DAM is designed to manage large photo/video collections across offline storage devices. In practice, photographers use DAM alongside tools like CaptureOne, Lightroom, or RawTherapee — tools that move, rename, and annotate files independently.

A typical CaptureOne session workflow looks like this:

1. **Import to CaptureOne** — RAW files land in the session's `Capture/` folder
2. **Initial cull & tag** — Photographer adds session keywords, basic ratings in CaptureOne
3. **Import to DAM** — `dam import` from `Capture/`, picking up XMP keywords and ratings
4. **Refine in CaptureOne** — Ratings adjusted, keywords refined, COS adjustments saved
5. **Select** — Chosen images moved to `Selects/` folder within the CaptureOne session
6. **Process & export** — Final edits applied, exports generated

DAM currently handles steps 2–4 well. Steps 5–6 (file movement, batch operations) still create friction, though DAM now has tools (`sync`, `cleanup`) to recover from external file moves.

This proposal identifies the gaps and suggests features to close them — not just for CaptureOne, but for any external tool that operates on the same files.

---

## Current Strengths

What already works well for this workflow:

- **Stem-based auto-grouping** — RAW + JPEG + XMP + COS are grouped into one asset automatically
- **Location-based recipe identity** — Re-importing a modified COS/XMP file updates its hash in place, no duplicates
- **XMP metadata extraction** — Keywords, rating, description, label, creator, rights are all captured
- **Re-import semantics** — Changed XMP data overwrites rating/description and merges keywords
- **XMP write-back** — Rating, tag, description, and color label changes are written back to `.xmp` files on disk, enabling bidirectional sync with CaptureOne (v0.4.1–v0.4.4)
- **Multi-location tracking** — An asset can exist on multiple volumes simultaneously
- **Content-addressed integrity** — SHA-256 hashes detect corruption and enable deduplication
- **File type group filtering** — `--include captureone` / `--skip captureone` controls recipe import
- **External change recovery** — `dam sync` detects moved/modified/missing files, `dam cleanup` removes stale records
- **CLI metadata editing** — `dam edit` for name, description, rating, color label; `dam tag` for tags
- **Web UI inline editing** — Star rating, tags, description, and color label editable on asset detail page
- **Batch operations** — Multi-select with checkbox, batch tag/untag, batch rating, batch color label via fixed toolbar (v0.4.3–v0.4.4)
- **Color labels** — First-class 7-color label support (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Pink, Purple) with XMP `xmp:Label` extraction, CLI editing, web UI color dot picker, browse filtering, and XMP write-back (v0.4.4)

## Identified Gaps

### ~~1. External File Movement Goes Undetected~~ — **RESOLVED**

Addressed by `dam sync` (detects moved/new/missing files), `dam cleanup` (removes stale records and orphans), `dam update-location` (manual path correction), and search filters (`missing:true`, `orphan:true`, `stale:N`, `volume:none`).

### ~~2. No Metadata Sync After External Edits~~ — **RESOLVED**

XMP write-back (v0.4.1–v0.4.3) enables DAM→CaptureOne sync for rating, tags, and description. `dam refresh` provides lightweight CaptureOne→DAM sync by re-reading metadata from changed sidecar/recipe files without a full re-import. Together with `dam sync --apply` (which detects moved/modified/missing files), bidirectional metadata sync is complete.

### ~~3. No Batch Operations in Web UI~~ — **RESOLVED**

Addressed by multi-select checkboxes on browse cards, a fixed bottom toolbar with batch tag (add/remove), batch rating (set/clear), and batch color label (set/clear). Selection state survives pagination/sort. Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl+A to select all on page, Escape to clear. Backend: `POST /api/batch/tags`, `PUT /api/batch/rating`, `PUT /api/batch/label`. Implemented in v0.4.3–v0.4.4.

### ~~4. Limited Metadata Editing~~ — **RESOLVED**

Name, description, rating, and color label are editable via CLI (`dam edit`). All fields are editable inline in the web UI (stars for rating, color dots for label, pencil-icon toggle for name and description). Changes are written back to XMP sidecar files on disk.

### ~~5. No Saved Searches or Collections~~ — **RESOLVED**

Addressed by `dam saved-search` (alias `ss`) for saved searches (smart albums) stored in `searches.toml`, and `dam collection` (alias `col`) for static collections backed by SQLite + `collections.yaml`. Web UI includes clickable saved search chips on the browse page and a `/collections` page. Search filter `collection:<name>` restricts results to collection members. Implemented in v0.6.0.

### ~~6. No Dry-Run Import~~ — **RESOLVED**

Addressed by `dam import --dry-run` which previews what an import would do (new assets, location additions, recipe updates) without writing to catalog, sidecar, or disk. Files are still hashed for duplicate detection. Supports `--json` and `--log`. Implemented in v0.5.1.

---

## Proposed Features

### Phase 1: External Change Detection & Location Management — **COMPLETE**

All features in this phase are implemented.

#### 1.1 `dam sync` Command — **IMPLEMENTED** (v0.3.1)

Implemented as `dam sync <PATHS...> [--volume <label>] [--apply] [--remove-stale]`. Report-only by default (safe); `--apply` writes changes. `--remove-stale` (requires `--apply`) removes catalog locations for missing files. Detects unchanged, moved, new, modified, and missing files. New files are not auto-imported — user runs `dam import` separately.

#### 1.2 `dam cleanup` Command — **done** (v0.3.1, extended v0.3.4)

Remove stale location records, orphaned assets, and orphaned preview files:

```
dam cleanup [--volume <label>] [--list] [--apply]
```

- Report-only by default (safe); `--apply` writes changes
- **Pass 1:** Iterates all file locations and recipes on the specified volume (or all online volumes), reports and optionally removes records for missing files
- **Pass 2:** Deletes orphaned assets (all variants have zero file_locations) including their recipes, variants, catalog rows, and sidecar YAML
- **Pass 3:** Removes orphaned preview files (content hash no longer matches any variant)
- Report-only mode predicts orphans that would result from removing stale locations

#### 1.3 Search Filters for Location Health — **done** (v0.3.3)

New search filters to find assets needing attention:

- `missing:true` — Assets where at least one location points to a non-existent file
- `orphan:true` — Assets with zero file_location records
- `stale:N` — Assets with at least one location not verified in N days (or never verified)
- `volume:none` — Assets with no locations on any online volume

#### 1.4 `dam update-location` Command — **done**

Manually update a file's location when you know where it moved:

```
dam update-location <asset-id> --from <old-path> --to <new-path> [--volume <label>]
```

Implemented as `dam update-location <asset-id> --from <old-path> --to <new-path> [--volume <label>]`. `--to` must be an absolute path; `--from` can be absolute or volume-relative. Auto-detects volume from `--to` path. Verifies content hash at new location matches catalog record. Updates both SQLite and sidecar YAML. Handles variant file locations and recipe file locations.

---

### Phase 2: Metadata Sync & Re-import Improvements — **COMPLETE**

#### 2.1 `dam refresh` Command — **IMPLEMENTED** (v0.4.5)

Re-read metadata from sidecar files (XMP, COS) without a full import:

```
dam refresh [PATHS...] [--volume <label>] [--asset <id>] [--dry-run]
```

- Finds all recipe/sidecar files for matching assets
- Compares current hash to stored hash
- If changed: re-extract metadata (XMP keywords, rating, description, color label) and update catalog
- `--dry-run` shows what would change without applying
- Supports `--json`, `--log`, `--time` flags

This is lighter than `sync` — it only touches metadata, not file locations.

#### 2.2 Dry-Run Mode for Import — **IMPLEMENTED** (v0.5.1)

```
dam import --dry-run <PATHS...>
```

Preview what an import would do:
- N new assets to create
- N new locations to add to existing assets
- N recipes to attach/update
- N files to skip (already tracked)

No files written, no catalog changes. Files are still hashed for duplicate detection. Supports `--json` (includes `dry_run: true` field) and `--log` for per-file details.

#### 2.3 `dam edit` Command — **IMPLEMENTED** (v0.3.1, extended v0.4.4)

Implemented as `dam edit <asset-id> [--name <name>] [--description <text>] [--rating <1-5>] [--label <color>] [--clear-name] [--clear-description] [--clear-rating] [--clear-label]`. Supports `--json`. Rating, description, and color label changes trigger XMP write-back.

---

### Phase 3: Web UI Workflow Improvements — **COMPLETE**

#### 3.1 Multi-Select & Batch Operations — **IMPLEMENTED** (v0.4.3–v0.4.4)

- **Checkbox selection** on browse cards (hover-visible, always-visible when any selected)
- **Fixed bottom toolbar** appearing when assets are selected:
  - Tag input with "+ Tag" / "− Tag" buttons
  - 5 rating stars with clear (×)
  - 7 color label dots with clear (×)
  - "Select page" / "Clear" buttons, selection count
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Cmd/Ctrl+A selects all on page, Escape clears selection
- Selection state survives htmx pagination/sort swaps
- Backend: `POST /api/batch/tags`, `PUT /api/batch/rating`, `PUT /api/batch/label`
- Each individual operation triggers XMP write-back

#### 3.2 Description & Name Editing — **IMPLEMENTED** (v0.4.3–v0.5.1)

- ~~Inline-editable description field on asset detail page~~ — **done** (pencil icon, textarea, Save/Cancel, `PUT /api/asset/{id}/description`, XMP write-back)
- ~~Inline-editable asset name~~ — **done** (pencil icon, text input, Save/Cancel, `PUT /api/asset/{id}/name`; empty clears name, shows filename fallback)

#### 3.3 Keyboard Navigation — **IMPLEMENTED** (v0.4.5)

- Arrow keys (← → ↑ ↓) to move between assets in browse grid (column-aware)
- Number keys (1–5) to rate focused asset or batch selection, 0 to clear rating
- Alt/Option+1–7 to set color label, Alt+0 to clear; letter keys r/o/y/g/b/p/u/x for quick label
- Enter to open asset detail
- Escape clears selection first, then focus
- Spacebar to toggle selection of focused card

Rating and label shortcuts operate on the focused card when no batch selection is active, or on all selected cards when batch selection is active. This turns the web UI into a viable culling/review tool matching CaptureOne's keyboard-driven workflow speed.

#### 3.4 Saved Searches & Collections — **IMPLEMENTED** (v0.6.0)

- **Saved searches** (`dam saved-search` / `dam ss`): Named queries stored in `searches.toml` at the catalog root. CLI: `save`, `list`, `run`, `delete` subcommands. Web UI: clickable chips on the browse page load saved searches into filter dropdowns; save button captures current search state; chips show rename (…) and delete (×) buttons on hover. API: `GET/POST /api/saved-searches`, `DELETE /api/saved-searches/{name}`.
- **Collections** (`dam collection` / `dam col`): Manually curated asset ID lists backed by SQLite tables + `collections.yaml` for persistence across `rebuild-catalog`. CLI: `create`, `list`, `show`, `add`, `remove`, `delete` subcommands. Stdin piping: `dam search -q "rating:5" | xargs dam col add "Best"`. Search filter: `collection:<name>`. Web UI: `/collections` page, collection membership chips with × remove buttons on asset detail, collection filter dropdown in browse filter row (v0.6.2, composable with all other filters), context-sensitive batch toolbar ("+ Collection" / "− Collection" synced from filter dropdown). API: `GET/POST /api/collections`, `POST/DELETE /api/batch/collection`.
- **Quoted filter values**: Search parser supports double-quoted values for multi-word filters (`tag:"Fools Theater"`, `collection:"My Favorites"`).

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Integration (Future)

These are longer-term ideas, listed for completeness.

#### 4.1 Watch Mode

```
dam watch [PATHS...] [--volume <label>]
```

File system watcher (via `notify` crate) that auto-imports/syncs when files change. Useful for monitoring a CaptureOne session's output folder during an active editing session.

#### ~~4.2 XMP Write-Back~~ — **IMPLEMENTED** (v0.4.1–v0.4.4)

Rating (v0.4.1), tags (v0.4.2), description (v0.4.3), and color label (v0.4.4) are written back to `.xmp` recipe files on disk whenever changed via CLI or web UI. Uses string-based find/replace to preserve XMP structure. Re-hashes files and updates catalog after modification. Enables bidirectional sync with CaptureOne.

#### 4.3 Export Command

```
dam export <query> --target <path> [--format <preset>] [--include-sidecars]
```

Export matching assets to a directory, optionally with sidecars. Useful for preparing files for delivery or for feeding into another tool.

#### ~~4.4 Collections~~ — **IMPLEMENTED** (v0.6.0)

Implemented as `dam collection` (alias `col`) with SQLite-backed storage and YAML persistence. See Phase 3.4 above for details.

The remaining Phase 4 items are longer-term enhancements:

1. **Watch mode (4.1)** — File system watcher for auto-import/sync during active editing sessions.
2. **Export command (4.3)** — Batch export of matching assets with optional sidecars for delivery or tool handoff.
