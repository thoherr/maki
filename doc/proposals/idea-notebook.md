# Idea Notebook: Musings about possible future features

This is a unstructured collection of ideas that came to mind while working on and with my dam system.

## Data storage

### XMP sync / resolution for multi volume duplicates

Maybe we could come up with ideas how to synchronize recipe files across volumes. this is especially critical for
the use case we have a ssd work hard drive (volume role working) vs. the storage drive (role archive). A merge of the
data is probably ways to complicated, maybe a "last one wins" approach is sufficient?

## UX / UI

### ~~Text field with chips~~ — **DONE** (v1.8.8, format filter)

Implemented as a **grouped multi-select dropdown panel** for the format filter on the browse page. A compact trigger button opens a scrollable panel with formats organized into five categories (RAW, Image, Video, Audio, Other). Each category has a group-level toggle checkbox ("All RAW", etc.) and individual format checkboxes with variant counts (e.g., `NEF (42)`). Selected formats are OR-combined in the backend query (`format=jpg,nef,mp4`).

The trigger button label adapts smartly: "All formats" when empty, the format name when one is selected, the group name when an entire group is selected ("All RAW"), or a compact summary with overflow ("JPG +2...") for mixed selections — full list shown as hover tooltip. Group toggles support indeterminate state for partial selections. Checkbox changes trigger search immediately (no debounce). State persists across browser back/forward via URL params and popstate handler.

Could still be extended to types, volumes, and collections if the same pattern proves useful there.

### ~~Complex queries~~ **DONE** (v1.8.6)

Currently we only have simple queries, and all of them are anded in the query.
Some sort of logical query language could be useful (e.g. "find all vacation images, but not from france"
or "give me all images with tags "alice" or "bob").

### ~~Asset folder link~~ — **DONE** (v1.8.2)

Implemented as reveal-in-file-manager (📂) and open-terminal (`>_`) buttons on the asset detail page, next to each file location on online volumes. Supports macOS (Finder/Terminal.app), Linux (xdg-open/terminal emulators), and Windows (Explorer/cmd). Backed by `POST /api/open-location` and `POST /api/open-terminal` endpoints.

## CLI

### ~~Scripting example~~ - **DONE** (v1.8.5)

Since the CLI can provide information in machine readable JSON format, one or more small example scripts
(e.g. in Python, Ruby or even as Bash-Script) for how to use it may be helpful. Maybe something like "find all paths
with pictures of Alices birthday and copy the two highest rated images with Bob to a sd card" (where the names would
of cource have been tagged). Or maybe we come up with another, more useful example.

### ~~delete command~~ — **DONE** (v1.8.7)

Would be ver useful if we have orphaned files or other import bugs. Currently this is solved by quite complex and long
running commands, whereas we often know that we just have to delete (and maybe re-import) a certain asset.

## Documentation

### ~~Cross References in the PDF manual do not work (they link to the *.md file) - BUG~~ **DONE** (v1.8.5)
