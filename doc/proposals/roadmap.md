# MAKI Roadmap

Living document tracking planned enhancements. Previous proposals (all implemented or deferred) are in `archive/`. Active proposals are in `doc/proposals/`.

Current version: **v4.0.9** (2026-03-22)

## Active Proposals

### Similarity Stacking (Phase 3)

Auto-discover visual clusters across the catalog and propose stacks. See `doc/proposals/similarity-browse-and-grouping.md`.

**Status:** Phase 1 (similarity browse) and Phase 2 (stack-by-similarity from detail page) implemented in v4.0.2. Phase 3 (catalog-wide auto-stack) pending.

**Scope:**
- `maki auto-stack --threshold 85` — scan all embedded assets, cluster by similarity, propose stacks
- Pick selection: highest-rated in each cluster
- `--dry-run` for review, `--apply` to create
- Clustering algorithm: greedy connected-components over embedding similarity matrix

**Complexity:** Medium. Embedding infrastructure and stacking exist; needs clustering algorithm and CLI command.

## Tier 1 — High Value

### Watch Mode

Auto-import and sync on filesystem changes. After a CaptureOne session, new files appear in the catalog without manual `maki import`.

**Scope:**
- `maki watch [PATHS...] [--volume <label>]` — monitors directories for new/changed files
- Poll-based initially (simple, cross-platform); fsevents/inotify optional later
- Triggers import for new files, refresh for changed recipes
- Configurable via `[watch]` section in `maki.toml` (poll interval, exclude patterns)
- Runs as foreground process (like `maki serve`), logs activity to stderr

**Complexity:** Medium. Core import/refresh logic exists; needs a polling loop and file-change detection.

### GPU-Accelerated Embeddings (Linux/Windows)

SigLIP embedding generation on CPU is slow for large catalogs. GPU backends make batch embedding practical at scale.

**Status:** CoreML (macOS) implemented in v2.4.1 via `--features ai-gpu`. Linux/Windows pending.

**Open:**
- CUDA execution provider for Linux (requires `ort/cuda` feature, CUDA Toolkit + cuDNN)
- DirectML execution provider for Windows (requires `ort/directml` feature)
- Testing on Linux and Windows platforms
- Batch processing with GPU-optimal batch sizes

**Complexity:** Low for adding providers (code pattern exists), high for testing/packaging across platforms.

### IPTC/EXIF Write-Back

Write metadata changes back into JPEG/TIFF files directly, not just XMP sidecars. Some workflows and stock photo submissions require embedded metadata.

**Scope:**
- `maki writeback --embed` writes rating, tags, description, label into file's embedded metadata
- IPTC keywords, caption/description, urgency (mapped from rating)
- Preserves existing embedded metadata; only updates DAM-managed fields
- Re-hashes file after write, updates variant content hash

**Complexity:** High. Modifying binary file metadata without corruption requires careful handling.

---

### Web UI Export Progress

The ZIP export modal shows "Preparing..." with no progress feedback.

**Scope:**
- Server sends export plan summary (file count, estimated size) before starting
- Client shows a progress bar or asset counter
- Warn before very large downloads (> 1 GB)

**Complexity:** Low-Medium.

---

## Tier 2 — Workflow Convenience

### Import Profiles

Named preset configurations for different import scenarios (studio shoot, travel, phone backup).

**Scope:**
- `[import.profiles.<name>]` sections in `maki.toml`
- `maki import --profile studio <PATHS...>` selects a profile
- Profiles inherit from `[import]` defaults, override specific fields

**Complexity:** Low.

### Multi-User Web Access

Allow browsing the catalog from other devices on the LAN.

**Scope:**
- `--read-only` mode: disables all write endpoints
- Optional basic auth (`[serve] username/password` in `maki.toml`)
- Responsive CSS improvements for mobile viewports

**Complexity:** Low-Medium.

### Volume Health Monitoring

Surface drive health and verification staleness proactively.

**Scope:**
- Per-volume staleness warnings in `maki stats --verified`
- `maki verify --report` health summary
- Web UI volume health indicators on backup page

**Complexity:** Low.

## Tier 3 — Polish & Future

### Undo / Edit History

Track metadata changes with timestamps for audit trail and undo capability.

**Scope:**
- `asset_history` table: asset_id, field, old_value, new_value, timestamp, source
- `maki history <asset-id>` and `maki undo <asset-id>`
- Web UI history panel on detail page

**Complexity:** High.
