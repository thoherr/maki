# Roadmap: Planned & Proposed Features

Consolidated list of unimplemented features and new ideas, organized by theme. Items from `enhancements.md` and `proposal-future-enhancements.md` are merged here with updated priorities reflecting the current state of the project (v1.6.3).

The main focus is on an **optimized workflow for finding, evaluating, and managing the best images** from a large multi-year archive, and on getting a **clear overview of assets** across volumes.

---

## Tier 1 — High-Impact Workflow Features

### 1. Side-by-Side Compare

Select 2–4 assets and view them in a split layout with synchronized zoom and pan.

**Web UI:** `/compare?ids=a,b,c` page. Each asset fills an equal portion of the viewport. Scroll/zoom on one image applies to all (synchronized via JS). Toggle sync on/off. Show key metadata below each image (name, rating, label, focal length, aperture, ISO, shutter speed). Rating and label editable inline.

**Trigger:** "Compare" button in the batch toolbar when 2–4 assets are selected. Keyboard shortcut `c` in the browse grid when 2–4 cards are selected.

**Why:** Essential for choosing between similar shots (same scene, different exposure/composition). Currently requires opening multiple browser tabs or relying on memory.

**Prerequisites:** Smart previews (below) would make this usable for offline volumes.

---

### 2. Map View for Geotagged Photos

EXIF GPS coordinates are already extracted into `source_metadata` during import. A map view would surface this data.

**Web UI:** `/map` page with an OpenStreetMap tile layer (Leaflet.js). Assets with GPS data shown as clustered markers. Click a cluster to see thumbnails. Click a thumbnail to open the asset detail page or lightbox. Filter controls (same as browse page) narrow the visible markers.

**Search filter:** `geo:<lat>,<lng>,<radius_km>` or `geo:<south>,<west>,<north>,<east>` bounding box.

**Schema:** Add indexed `latitude REAL` and `longitude REAL` columns on the `assets` table (denormalized from primary variant's `source_metadata` GPS fields). Backfill during migration.

**Why:** Spatial browsing is a natural complement to temporal browsing (calendar view). Essential for travel photography, event coverage, and "where was this taken?" queries. Combined with date and tag filters, enables powerful multi-dimensional browsing.

---

### 3. Smart Previews for Offline Browsing

Current previews are 800px thumbnails — enough for browse cards but too small for meaningful evaluation in the lightbox or compare view.

**Command:** `dam generate-smart-previews [--asset <id>] [--volume <label>] [--max-edge <N>]`

**Behavior:** Generate a second tier of previews at 2560px (configurable), stored as lossy JPEG/WebP in `smart-previews/<hash-prefix>/<hash>.jpg`. Used by the lightbox and compare view when the source volume is offline. Config: `[preview]` section gains `smart_max_edge` (default 2560) and `smart_quality` (default 85).

**Web UI:** Lightbox automatically uses smart preview when available, falling back to 800px thumbnail. Compare view requires smart previews for meaningful side-by-side evaluation.

**Why:** The core value proposition is browsing without media mounted. 800px thumbnails limit this to the grid view. Smart previews extend offline utility to full-screen review, rating, and comparison — the workflow that matters most for culling.

---

### 4. AI-Assisted Tagging & Visual Similarity

Integrate with a local vision model to suggest tags from image content and enable visual similarity search.

**Command:** `dam auto-tag [--asset <id>] [--model clip] [--threshold 0.5] [--apply]`

**Approach:** Use CLIP embeddings (via `ort` crate for ONNX runtime, or shell out to a Python process) to classify images against a configurable label set. Suggest tags with confidence scores. Store embeddings per-variant for similarity queries.

**Visual similarity:** `dam search --similar <asset-id>` — find the N most visually similar assets by cosine distance. Web UI: "Find similar" button on asset detail page.

**Web UI:** "Suggest tags" button on asset detail page shows suggested tags with confidence badges. Click to accept individually or "Accept all."

**Why:** Manual tagging is the biggest friction point. Even 70–80% accuracy dramatically speeds up the workflow. Visual similarity helps find related shots across sessions. Local models (CLIP, SigLIP) avoid privacy concerns.

## Tier 2 — Workflow Convenience

### 5. Import Profiles

Named presets for common import scenarios, configured in `dam.toml`.

```toml
[import.profiles.tethered]
include = ["raw"]
auto_tags = ["inbox", "tethered"]
exclude = ["*.tmp", "*.lock"]

[import.profiles.export]
include = ["image"]
skip = ["raw"]
auto_tags = ["export", "review"]
```

**Usage:** `dam import --profile tethered /Volumes/Photos/Capture/`

**Why:** Power users repeat the same import flag combinations. Profiles reduce typing and prevent mistakes. Natural extension of the existing `[import]` config.

---

### 6. Watch Mode

```
dam watch [PATHS...] [--volume <label>] [--profile <name>]
```

File system watcher (via `notify` crate) that auto-imports/syncs when files change. Useful for monitoring a CaptureOne session's output folder during active editing.

**Use cases:**
- Tethered shooting: new RAW files auto-imported
- Export monitoring: processed TIFFs/JPEGs picked up and grouped with RAW originals
- Recipe changes: XMP/COS modifications detected and metadata refreshed in real time

**Design considerations:**
- Debounce events (files written in stages)
- Volume mount/unmount handling
- Optional auto preview generation
- Foreground process vs. background daemon
- Combine with import profiles for scenario-specific behavior

---

### 7. Export Command

```
dam export <query> --target <path> [--format <preset>] [--include-sidecars] [--dry-run]
```

Export matching assets to a directory, optionally with sidecars.

**Use cases:**
- `dam export "rating:5 tag:portfolio" --target /tmp/delivery/` — gather best-of for client delivery
- `dam export "collection:Print" --target /Volumes/USB/ --include-sidecars` — with XMP/COS for another workstation
- `dam export "tag:instagram" --target ~/Export/ --format flat` — flat directory for social media

**Options:** Copy vs. symlink, mirror source paths vs. flat, filename conflict resolution (hash suffix, sequence number), primary variant only vs. all variants.

---

### 8. Undo / Edit History

Track metadata changes with timestamps for auditability and mistake recovery.

**Data model:** Add a `history` list to sidecar YAML:

```yaml
history:
  - timestamp: 2026-02-23T14:30:00Z
    field: rating
    old: 3
    new: 5
  - timestamp: 2026-02-23T14:31:00Z
    field: tags
    action: add
    values: [portfolio]
```

**CLI:** `dam history <asset-id>` shows the changelog. `dam undo <asset-id>` reverts the last change.

**Web UI:** History panel on asset detail page (collapsible). Undo button per entry.

**Why:** Batch operations on large selections are powerful but error-prone. "I accidentally set 200 assets to 1 star" has no recovery path today.

---

## Tier 3 — Polish & Advanced

### 9. IPTC / Structured Metadata

Support IPTC Core fields for professional photographers and stock agencies: headline, caption, copyright notice, creator, credit line, source, usage terms, city, country, sublocation.

**Data model:** `iptc_metadata: HashMap<String, String>` on Asset, stored in sidecar YAML, indexed in SQLite for searchable fields.

**Search:** `iptc:city=Berlin`, `iptc:country=Germany`.

**Why:** Stock photographers need IPTC for agency submission. Currently this data is buried in `source_metadata`.

---

### 10. Drag-and-Drop Enhancements

**Stack reordering:** Drag to reorder stack members on the asset detail page. DOM reordering triggers backend position updates.

**Collection management:** Drag asset cards from the browse grid onto collection chips in a sidebar. Add `position INTEGER` to `collection_assets` for manual ordering. Drag to reorder within a collection view.

**Why:** Direct manipulation feels more natural than dropdown+button workflows for curation tasks.

---

### 11. Statistics & Insights Dashboard

Expand the stats page with visual analytics for large archives:

- **Shooting frequency chart** — assets per month/year as a bar chart (complements the calendar heatmap)
- **Gear usage breakdown** — shots per camera body, per lens, showing which gear gets used most
- **Rating distribution** — histogram of ratings across the catalog, per collection, or per time period
- **Label workflow funnel** — how many assets at each color label stage (useful when labels represent workflow states like "review → select → edit → deliver")
- **Storage growth over time** — cumulative bytes per volume, showing growth trajectory
- **Tag cloud** — weighted visualization of tag frequency (already have the data from tags page)

**Why:** Large archives accumulate metadata that tells a story about shooting habits, gear usage, and workflow efficiency. Currently this requires manual SQL queries or export+spreadsheet.

---

### 12. Faceted Browse Sidebar

Replace or supplement the top filter row with a persistent left sidebar showing faceted navigation:

- **Tags:** Collapsible tree (reuse tags page component), click to toggle filter
- **Dates:** Year > Month > Day drill-down with counts
- **Volumes:** List with online/offline indicators and counts
- **Ratings:** Star filter with count per rating level
- **Labels:** Color dots with counts
- **Collections:** List with counts

Each facet updates counts in real time based on the current filter combination (like e-commerce faceted search).

**Why:** The current filter row works but doesn't show the distribution of values or give a sense of "what's available." A sidebar with counts enables discovery ("I have 340 unrated assets from 2024") and helps narrow searches iteratively.
