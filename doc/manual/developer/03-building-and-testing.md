# Building & Testing

## Building

### Debug Build

```bash
cargo build
```

Produces an unoptimized binary at `target/debug/maki` with debug symbols and runtime checks enabled. Fast compilation, suitable for development.

### Release Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Produces an optimized binary at `target/release/maki`. Significantly faster runtime performance. Use this for production deployment.

### Pro Build

```bash
cargo build --features pro
cargo build --release --features pro
```

Builds the **Pro** edition with SigLIP-based zero-shot image classification, face detection/recognition, and visual similarity search. The `pro` feature enables `ai` automatically. Adds ONNX Runtime (`ort`), `ndarray`, and `tokenizers` as dependencies. The ONNX Runtime shared library is downloaded automatically during build. Without `--features pro` (or `--features ai`), these dependencies are not compiled and AI commands (`auto-tag`, `embed`, `faces`) are not available.

### Requirements

- **Rust edition**: 2021 (stable toolchain)
- **Platforms**: macOS, Linux, Windows
- **SQLite**: Bundled via `rusqlite` with the `bundled` feature (no system SQLite required)

## Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

Runs approximately 693 tests total: ~465 unit tests and ~228 integration tests. With `--features pro` (or `--features ai`), adds ~41 unit tests and ~13 integration tests.

### Unit Tests Only

```bash
cargo test --lib
```

Runs the ~465 unit tests embedded in library source files (`#[cfg(test)]` modules within `src/`).

### Integration Tests Only

```bash
cargo test --test integration
```

Runs the ~228 integration tests defined in `tests/cli.rs`. These tests exercise the full system through the CLI binary and library API, using temporary catalogs and volumes.

### Run a Specific Test

```bash
cargo test test_name_pattern
```

Runs only tests whose names match the given pattern.

### Test Helpers

The integration test suite provides helper functions for setting up test catalogs:

- **`setup_search_catalog()`** -- Creates a catalog with pre-populated assets for search testing. Requires `asset.variants` to be populated before calling `catalog.insert_asset()` (because denormalized columns `best_variant_hash`, `primary_variant_format`, and `variant_count` are computed at insert time).

- **`setup_metadata_catalog()`** -- Creates a catalog with assets that have metadata (tags, ratings, descriptions, recipes) for metadata operation testing. Same requirement: variants must be populated before insert.

## Documentation

### Rust API Docs

```bash
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

Generates HTML documentation from doc comments and opens it in your browser. The `--no-deps` flag skips building docs for third-party dependencies, which speeds up the build considerably. Output is at `target/doc/maki/`.

### PDF Manual

```bash
bash doc/manual/build-pdf.sh
```

Generates `doc/manual/maki-manual.pdf` from the 21 Markdown source files. The script concatenates all sections in order, renders mermaid diagrams to PNG, and produces a PDF with table of contents, headers/footers, and syntax-highlighted code blocks. The version number is read from `Cargo.toml`.

**Prerequisites** (not required for building or running maki itself):

- **pandoc** -- Document conversion. `brew install pandoc`
- **XeLaTeX** -- PDF typesetting with Unicode support. `brew install --cask mactex-no-gui`
- **mermaid-cli** (`mmdc`) -- Diagram rendering. `brew install mermaid-cli`

## Release Process

1. **Update documentation**: User manual, README, CHANGELOG, and any other docs affected by the release.

2. **Bump version** in `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [package]
   version = "X.Y.Z"
   ```

3. **Update lockfile**:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
   This regenerates `Cargo.lock` with the new version.

4. **Run all tests**:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```
   All tests must pass before releasing.

5. **Commit**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z -- brief description"
   ```

6. **Tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   ```

7. **Push**:
   ```bash
   git push && git push --tags
   ```

8. **Create GitHub release**:
   ```bash
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "changelog content here"
   ```

| `tempfile` | Temporary directories for test isolation |

### External Tools (Highly Recommended)

These tools are not Rust dependencies but are invoked as subprocesses for specific preview generation tasks. Their absence does not prevent the application from running; missing tools result in info card fallback previews.

- **dcraw** or **LibRaw** (`dcraw_emu`) -- RAW image preview extraction. Used to decode camera-native formats (NEF, ARW, CR2, CR3, etc.) into RGB data for thumbnail generation. LibRaw's `dcraw_emu` is preferred when available.

- **ffmpeg** -- Video thumbnail extraction. Used to capture a frame from video files (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.) for preview generation.

- **curl** -- Model file download for AI auto-tagging *(Pro)* and VLM image descriptions (`maki describe`). Used to download ONNX model files from HuggingFace. Available by default on macOS and most Linux distributions.

**Install on macOS** (Homebrew):

```bash
brew install libraw ffmpeg curl
```

**Install on Linux** (package manager):

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libraw-bin ffmpeg curl

# Fedora
sudo dnf install LibRaw ffmpeg curl
```

**Install on Windows** (winget or scoop):

```powershell
# winget
winget install LibRaw.LibRaw Gyan.FFmpeg cURL.cURL

# scoop
scoop install libraw ffmpeg curl
```

To check if these tools are available:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
which dcraw_emu || which dcraw
which ffmpeg
which curl
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-Command dcraw_emu -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-Command ffmpeg -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-Command curl -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Preview generation silently falls back to info cards (metadata display images) when these tools are missing. Use `maki generate-previews --debug` to see external tool invocations and errors.
