# Search Filter Reference

Complete reference for all search filters available in `dam search`, the web UI browse page, and saved searches. Filters use a `key:value` syntax and can be mixed freely with free-text terms in a single query string.

All filters combine with AND -- every filter must match for an asset to appear in results.

---

## Free Text

**Syntax:** any token that does not match a recognized `prefix:value` pattern

**Description:** Remaining tokens after all prefix filters are extracted are joined into a single free-text string. This text is matched against asset names, original filenames, descriptions, and source metadata values (partial, case-insensitive).

**Examples:**

```
dam search "sunset"
dam search "golden hour mountains"
dam search "sunset tag:landscape"       # "sunset" is free text, tag:landscape is a filter
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE (a.name LIKE '%text%' OR a.original_filename LIKE '%text%' OR a.description LIKE '%text%' OR v.source_metadata LIKE '%text%')`. Triggers a JOIN to the variants table for metadata matching.

---

## type

**Syntax:** `type:<value>`

**Values:** `image`, `video`, `audio`, `document`, `other`

**Description:** Filters by asset type. Exact match, case-sensitive.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "type:image"
dam search "type:video rating:3+"
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE a.asset_type = ?`. Pure assets-table filter, no JOIN required.

---

## tag

**Syntax:** `tag:<name>` or `tag:"<multi-word name>"`

**Description:** Filters to assets that have a specific tag. Exact match on tag name. Supports quoted values for multi-word tags.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "tag:landscape"
dam search 'tag:"Fools Theater"'
dam search 'tag:"Black and White" rating:4+'
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM tags t WHERE t.asset_id = a.id AND t.tag = ?)`. Subquery on the tags table.

---

## format

**Syntax:** `format:<extension>`

**Description:** Filters by file format (extension) of any variant on the asset. Case-insensitive match against the variant's format field.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "format:nef"
dam search "format:jpg"
dam search "format:mp4 type:video"
dam search "format:tif tag:processed"
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE v.format = ?`. Triggers a JOIN to the variants table.

---

## rating

**Syntax:** `rating:<N>` (exact) or `rating:<N>+` (minimum)

**Values:** 1 through 5

**Description:** Filters by the asset's star rating. Use a bare number for exact match, or append `+` for "this rating or higher."

**Examples:**

```
dam search "rating:5"          # exactly 5 stars
dam search "rating:3+"         # 3 stars or more
dam search "rating:4+ tag:landscape"
```

**SQL behavior:**
- Exact: `WHERE a.rating = ?`
- Minimum: `WHERE a.rating >= ?`

Pure assets-table filter, no JOIN required.

---

## label

**Syntax:** `label:<color>`

**Values:** `Red`, `Orange`, `Yellow`, `Green`, `Blue`, `Pink`, `Purple` (case-insensitive input, stored as title-case)

**Description:** Filters by color label. The 7-color set is a superset of Lightroom's 5 colors, matching CaptureOne's label palette.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "label:Red"
dam search "label:blue"
dam search "label:Green rating:4+"
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE a.color_label = ?`. Pure assets-table filter, no JOIN required.

---

## camera

**Syntax:** `camera:<text>` or `camera:"<multi-word text>"`

**Description:** Partial match against the `camera_model` field in variant source metadata. Case-insensitive substring match.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "camera:fuji"
dam search 'camera:"Canon EOS R5"'
dam search 'camera:"NIKON Z 9" rating:4+'
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE v.source_metadata LIKE '%camera_model%' AND v.source_metadata LIKE '%value%'`. Triggers a JOIN to the variants table.

---

## lens

**Syntax:** `lens:<text>` or `lens:"<multi-word text>"`

**Description:** Partial match against the `lens` field in variant source metadata. Case-insensitive substring match.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "lens:56mm"
dam search 'lens:"RF 50mm f/1.2"'
dam search 'lens:"24-70" camera:sony'
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE v.source_metadata LIKE '%lens%' AND v.source_metadata LIKE '%value%'`. Triggers a JOIN to the variants table.

---

## iso

**Syntax:** `iso:<N>` (exact) or `iso:<N>+` (minimum) or `iso:<min>-<max>` (range)

**Description:** Filters by ISO sensitivity from variant source metadata. Supports exact match, minimum threshold, and inclusive range.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "iso:3200"          # exactly ISO 3200
dam search "iso:3200+"         # ISO 3200 or higher
dam search "iso:100-800"       # ISO between 100 and 800 inclusive
```

**SQL behavior:** Extracts the `iso` value from `v.source_metadata` JSON and applies numeric comparison. Triggers a JOIN to the variants table.

- Exact: sets both min and max to the same value
- Minimum (`+` suffix): sets min only, no upper bound
- Range: sets both min and max

---

## focal

**Syntax:** `focal:<N>` (exact) or `focal:<N>+` (minimum) or `focal:<min>-<max>` (range)

**Description:** Filters by focal length in millimeters from variant source metadata.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "focal:50"          # exactly 50mm
dam search "focal:200+"        # 200mm or longer
dam search "focal:35-70"       # between 35mm and 70mm inclusive
```

**SQL behavior:** Same pattern as `iso` but on the `focal_length` metadata field. Triggers a JOIN to the variants table.

---

## f (aperture)

**Syntax:** `f:<N>` (exact) or `f:<N>+` (minimum) or `f:<min>-<max>` (range)

**Description:** Filters by f-number (aperture) from variant source metadata. Supports decimal values.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "f:2.8"             # exactly f/2.8
dam search "f:1.4+"           # f/1.4 or wider (numerically >= 1.4)
dam search "f:1.4-2.8"        # between f/1.4 and f/2.8 inclusive
```

**SQL behavior:** Same pattern as `iso` but on the `f_number` metadata field with floating-point comparison. Triggers a JOIN to the variants table.

---

## width

**Syntax:** `width:<N>` (exact/minimum) or `width:<N>+` (minimum, explicit)

**Description:** Filters by image width in pixels from variant source metadata.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "width:4000+"       # 4000 pixels wide or more
dam search "width:3840"        # exactly 3840 pixels (4K UHD width)
dam search "width:4000+ height:2000+"
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE CAST(json_extract(v.source_metadata, '$.width') AS INTEGER) >= ?`. Triggers a JOIN to the variants table. Both bare numbers and `+`-suffixed numbers set a minimum threshold.

---

## height

**Syntax:** `height:<N>` (exact/minimum) or `height:<N>+` (minimum, explicit)

**Description:** Filters by image height in pixels from variant source metadata.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "height:2000+"      # 2000 pixels tall or more
dam search "height:2160"       # exactly 2160 pixels (4K UHD height)
```

**SQL behavior:** Same pattern as `width` but on the `height` metadata field. Triggers a JOIN to the variants table.

---

## meta

**Syntax:** `meta:<key>=<value>`

**Description:** Generic key-value match against variant source metadata. The key and value are matched against the JSON source_metadata blob. Useful for filtering on metadata fields that don't have a dedicated prefix filter.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "meta:software=CaptureOne"
dam search "meta:camera_make=SONY"
dam search "meta:color_space=sRGB"
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE v.source_metadata LIKE '%key%value%'`. Triggers a JOIN to the variants table. Multiple `meta:` filters can be specified and all must match (AND).

---

## path

**Syntax:** `path:<prefix>` or `path:"<prefix with spaces>"`

**Description:** Restricts results to assets that have at least one file location whose volume-relative path starts with the given prefix. Useful for finding everything imported from a specific directory.

**Automatic normalization** (CLI only, not in web UI or saved searches):

| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `path:Capture/2026` | Used as-is (volume-relative prefix match) |
| `path:~/Photos/2026` | `~` expanded to `$HOME`, then matched against volumes |
| `path:./subdir` | Resolved relative to current working directory |
| `path:../other` | Resolved relative to current working directory |
| `path:/Volumes/Photos/Capture/2026` | Stripped to `Capture/2026` with implicit `volume:` filter for the Photos volume |

An explicit `volume:` filter in the same query takes precedence over the auto-detected volume from path normalization.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "path:Capture/2026-02-22"
dam search 'path:"Photos/Family Trip"'
dam search "path:Capture/2026 rating:3+ tag:landscape"
dam search "path:/Volumes/Photos/Capture/2026"    # auto-normalized
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE fl.relative_path LIKE 'prefix%'`. Triggers a JOIN to the file_locations table.

---

## collection

**Syntax:** `collection:<name>` or `collection:"<multi-word name>"`

**Description:** Restricts results to assets that belong to a specific static collection (album). The collection's member asset IDs are pre-loaded and passed as a filter set.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "collection:Favorites"
dam search 'collection:"My Favorites"'
dam search 'collection:"Travel 2026" rating:4+'
```

**SQL behavior:** Pre-computes the set of asset IDs in the named collection, then filters with `WHERE a.id IN (...)`. Pure in-memory filter after initial lookup.

---

## volume

**Syntax:** `volume:<label>` (web UI and route handler) or `volume:none` (query parser)

**Description:** The `volume:none` special value finds assets with no file locations on any currently online volume. The `volume:<label>` form (used via the web UI dropdown or programmatically) restricts to assets with at least one file location on the specified volume.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "volume:none"                    # assets not on any online volume
dam search "volume:none orphan:false"       # has locations, but all on offline volumes
```

In the web UI, the volume filter is a dropdown control rather than a typed query token. It passes the volume UUID to the search backend.

**SQL behavior:**
- `volume:none`: Pre-computes online volume IDs from DeviceRegistry. Adds `WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM file_locations fl JOIN variants v ... WHERE fl.volume_id IN (...online_ids...))`.
- `volume:<id>`: `WHERE fl.volume_id = ?`. Triggers a JOIN to the file_locations table.

---

## orphan

**Syntax:** `orphan:true`

**Description:** Finds assets that have zero file location records in the catalog. These are assets whose files have all been removed (via cleanup or manual deletion) but whose metadata records remain.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "orphan:true"
dam search "orphan:true type:image"
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM file_locations fl JOIN variants v ON fl.content_hash = v.content_hash WHERE v.asset_id = a.id)`. Pure SQL subquery, no disk I/O.

---

## missing

**Syntax:** `missing:true`

**Description:** Finds assets where at least one file location points to a file that no longer exists on disk (on an online volume). This requires checking the filesystem and may be slow on large catalogs.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "missing:true"
dam search "missing:true type:video"
```

**SQL behavior:** Pre-computes affected asset IDs by iterating all file locations on online volumes and checking `Path::exists()`. The resulting ID set is passed as `WHERE a.id IN (...)`. Offline volumes are skipped.

---

## stale

**Syntax:** `stale:<N>`

**Values:** Number of days (0 or more)

**Description:** Finds assets with at least one file location that has not been verified in the specified number of days, or that has never been verified. Useful for identifying files due for integrity checks.

**Examples:**

```
dam search "stale:30"          # not verified in 30+ days (or never)
dam search "stale:0"           # never verified at all
dam search "stale:90 type:image"
```

**SQL behavior:** `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM file_locations fl JOIN variants v ... WHERE (fl.verified_at IS NULL OR fl.verified_at < datetime('now', '-N days')))`. Pure SQL, no disk I/O.

---

## Combining Filters

All filters are combined with AND logic. Every specified filter must match for an asset to appear in results. Free-text terms are also AND-combined with all prefix filters.

**Example combinations:**

```
# 5-star landscape images shot with a Nikon
dam search "rating:5 tag:landscape type:image camera:NIKON"

# High-ISO night shots in RAW format
dam search "iso:3200+ format:nef tag:night"

# Wide-angle portraits with shallow depth of field
dam search "focal:24-35 f:1.4-2.8 tag:portrait"

# Unverified images on the Photos volume, imported from a specific path
dam search "stale:30 type:image path:Capture/2026-01"

# 4K or larger images in a specific collection
dam search 'width:3840+ collection:"Best of 2026"'

# Orphaned video assets (no files on disk)
dam search "orphan:true type:video"

# Everything labeled Red with 4+ stars
dam search "label:Red rating:4+"
```

---

## Quoted Values

Use double quotes around filter values that contain spaces. When typing at the shell, wrap the entire query in single quotes to prevent the shell from stripping the inner double quotes.

```bash
# Shell-safe quoting: single quotes outside, double quotes for values
dam search 'tag:"Fools Theater"'
dam search 'camera:"Canon EOS R5" lens:"RF 50mm f/1.2"'
dam search 'collection:"My Favorites" rating:4+'
dam search 'path:"Photos/Family Trip" type:image'
```

Unquoted single-word values continue to work without quotes:

```bash
dam search "tag:landscape"
dam search "camera:fuji"
```
