## dam collection create

### NAME

dam-collection-create -- create a new collection

### SYNOPSIS

```
dam [GLOBAL FLAGS] collection create <NAME> [--description <TEXT>]
```

Alias: `dam col create`

### DESCRIPTION

Creates a new empty collection. Collections are manually curated lists of asset IDs, similar to static albums in photo management tools. They are backed by SQLite tables for fast queries and a `collections.yaml` file at the catalog root for persistence across `rebuild-catalog`.

Collection names must be unique. Attempting to create a collection with an existing name produces an error.

### ARGUMENTS

**NAME** (required)
: The name for the new collection.

### OPTIONS

**--description \<TEXT\>**
: An optional description for the collection.

`--json` outputs the created collection's details.

### EXAMPLES

Create a simple collection:

```bash
dam collection create "Best of 2026"
```

Create a collection with a description:

```bash
dam col create "Wedding Portfolio" --description "Final selects for client delivery"
```

Create with JSON output:

```bash
dam col create "Travel" --json
```

### SEE ALSO

[collection add](#dam-collection-add) -- add assets to a collection.
[collection show](#dam-collection-show) -- view collection contents.
[search](04-retrieve-commands.md#dam-search) -- `collection:` filter for searching within a collection.

## dam collection list

### NAME

dam-collection-list -- list all collections

### SYNOPSIS

```
dam [GLOBAL FLAGS] collection list
```

Alias: `dam col list`

### DESCRIPTION

Lists all collections in the catalog, showing each collection's name, description (if any), and the number of assets it contains.

### ARGUMENTS

None.

### OPTIONS

This command only accepts [global flags](00-cli-conventions.md#global-flags).

`--json` outputs an array of collection objects.

### EXAMPLES

List all collections:

```bash
dam collection list
```

List collections as JSON and extract names:

```bash
dam col list --json | jq '.[].name'
```

Count total collections:

```bash
dam col list --json | jq 'length'
```

```

Alias: `dam col show`

### DESCRIPTION

Displays the assets belonging to a collection. Output format can be customized using the same format presets and template syntax as `dam search`.

### ARGUMENTS

**NAME** (required)
: The name of the collection to display.

### OPTIONS

**--format \<FMT\>**
: Output format. Presets: `ids`, `short` (default), `full`, `json`. Custom templates use `{placeholder}` syntax (e.g., `'{id}\t{name}'`).

### SYNOPSIS

```
dam [GLOBAL FLAGS] saved-search save <NAME> <QUERY> [--sort <SORT>]
```

Alias: `dam ss save`

### DESCRIPTION

Saves a search query under a name for later re-use. Saved searches are stored in `searches.toml` at the catalog root and function as smart albums -- the results update dynamically as the catalog changes.

If a saved search with the same name already exists, it is replaced.

Saved searches appear as clickable chips in the web UI browse page and can be executed from the CLI with `dam saved-search run`.

### ARGUMENTS

**NAME** (required)
: A name for the saved search.

**QUERY** (required)
: The search query string, using the same syntax as `dam search`.

### OPTIONS

**--sort \<SORT\>**
: Sort order for results. Values: `date_desc` (default), `date_asc`, `name_asc`, `name_desc`, `size_asc`, `size_desc`.

`--json` outputs the saved search entry.

### EXAMPLES

Save a search for highly-rated landscapes:

```bash
dam saved-search save "Best Landscapes" "tag:landscape rating:4+"
```

Save with a custom sort order:

```bash
dam ss save "Recent Videos" "type:video" --sort date_desc
```

Save a search using quoted filter values:

```bash
dam ss save "Canon Portraits" 'camera:"Canon EOS R5" tag:portrait'
```

Save a path-scoped search:

```bash
dam ss save "February Shoot" "path:Capture/2026-02"

### ARGUMENTS

**NAME** (required)
: The name of the saved search to execute.

### OPTIONS

**--format \<FMT\>**
: Output format. Presets: `ids`, `short` (default), `full`, `json`. Custom templates use `{placeholder}` syntax.

## dam stack create

### NAME

dam-stack-create -- create a new stack from the given assets

### SYNOPSIS

```
dam [GLOBAL FLAGS] stack create <ASSET_IDS...>
```

Alias: `dam st create`

### DESCRIPTION

Creates a new stack from two or more assets. Stacks are lightweight anonymous groups for visually related images -- burst shots, bracketing sequences, similar scenes. The first asset ID becomes the stack's "pick" (displayed in the browse grid).

Each asset can belong to at most one stack. Attempting to stack an asset that is already in a stack produces an error.

Stacks are persisted in `stacks.yaml` at the catalog root and restored during `rebuild-catalog`.

### ARGUMENTS

**ASSET_IDS** (required)
: Two or more asset IDs. The first ID becomes the pick (position 0).

### OPTIONS

This command only accepts [global flags](00-cli-conventions.md#global-flags).

`--json` outputs the created stack's details (id, member_count, asset_ids).

### EXAMPLES

Create a stack from three burst shots (first becomes pick):

```bash
dam stack create a1b2c3d4-... e5f67890-... f1a2b3c4-...
```

Create using the alias with JSON output:

```bash
dam st create a1b2c3d4-... e5f67890-... --json
```

### SEE ALSO

[stack add](#dam-stack-add) -- add assets to an existing stack.
[stack pick](#dam-stack-pick) -- change which asset is the pick.
[stack dissolve](#dam-stack-dissolve) -- dissolve a stack entirely.

---

## dam stack add

### NAME

dam-stack-add -- add assets to an existing stack

### SYNOPSIS

```
dam [GLOBAL FLAGS] stack add <REFERENCE> <ASSET_IDS...>
```

Alias: `dam st add`

### DESCRIPTION

Adds one or more assets to an existing stack. The reference asset identifies which stack to add to -- it must already be a member of a stack. New assets are appended to the end of the stack's member list.

Assets that are already in a stack (any stack) cannot be added and will produce an error.

### ARGUMENTS

**REFERENCE** (required)
: Any asset ID that is already in the target stack.

**ASSET_IDS** (required)
: One or more asset IDs to add to the stack.

### OPTIONS

This command only accepts [global flags](00-cli-conventions.md#global-flags).

`--json` outputs `{"added": N}` with the count of assets added.

### EXAMPLES

Add an asset to the stack containing a1b2c3d4:

```bash
dam stack add a1b2c3d4-... new-asset-id-...
```

Add multiple assets:

```bash
dam st add a1b2c3d4-... b2c3d4e5-... c3d4e5f6-...
```

### SEE ALSO

[stack create](#dam-stack-create) -- create a new stack.
[stack remove](#dam-stack-remove) -- remove assets from a stack.

---

## dam stack remove

### NAME

dam-stack-remove -- remove assets from their stack

### SYNOPSIS

```
dam [GLOBAL FLAGS] stack remove <ASSET_IDS...>
```

Alias: `dam st remove`

### DESCRIPTION

Removes one or more assets from their stacks. Each asset is removed from whatever stack it belongs to. If removing an asset causes a stack to have fewer than 2 members, the stack is automatically dissolved.

Assets not currently in a stack are silently skipped.

### ARGUMENTS

**ASSET_IDS** (required)
: One or more asset IDs to remove from their stacks.

### OPTIONS

This command only accepts [global flags](00-cli-conventions.md#global-flags).

`--json` outputs `{"removed": N}` with the count of assets removed.

### EXAMPLES

Remove a single asset from its stack:

```bash
dam stack remove a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

Remove multiple assets:

```bash
dam st remove a1b2c3d4-... e5f67890-...
```

## dam stack pick

### NAME

dam-stack-pick -- set the pick (top) of a stack

### SYNOPSIS

```
dam [GLOBAL FLAGS] stack pick <ASSET_ID>
```

Alias: `dam st pick`

Promotes an asset to position 0 (the "pick") of its stack. The pick is the asset shown in the browse grid when stacks are collapsed. The asset must already be a member of a stack.

### ARGUMENTS

**ASSET_ID** (required)
: The asset ID to make the pick. Must be in a stack.

### OPTIONS

This command only accepts [global flags](00-cli-conventions.md#global-flags).

`--json` outputs `{"pick": "<asset_id>"}`.

### EXAMPLES

```

Set pick using the alias:

```bash
dam st pick a1b2c3d4-...
