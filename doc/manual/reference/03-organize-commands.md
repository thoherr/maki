# Organize Commands

Commands for curating static collections, managing saved searches (smart albums), grouping assets into stacks, and managing face recognition. Collections are manual albums; saved searches are dynamic queries that always reflect the current catalog state. Stacks collapse related assets in the browse grid.

| Command group | Subcommands |
|---------|-------------|
| [collection](#maki-collection-create) | create, list, show, add, remove, delete |
| [saved-search](#maki-saved-search-save) | save, list, run, delete |
| [stack](#maki-stack-create) | create, add, remove, pick, dissolve, list, show, from-tag |

## maki collection create

### NAME

maki-collection-create -- create a new collection

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] collection create <NAME> [--description <TEXT>]
```

Alias: `maki col create`

### DESCRIPTION

Creates a new empty collection. Collections are manually curated lists of asset IDs, similar to static albums in photo management tools. They are backed by SQLite tables for fast queries and a `collections.yaml` file at the catalog root for persistence across `rebuild-catalog`.

Collection names must be unique. Attempting to create a collection with an existing name produces an error.

### ARGUMENTS

**NAME** (required)
: The name for the new collection.

### OPTIONS

**--description \<TEXT\>**
: An optional description for the collection.

`--json` outputs the created collection's details.

### EXAMPLES

Create a simple collection:

```bash
maki collection create "Best of 2026"
```

Create a collection with a description:

```bash
maki col create "Wedding Portfolio" --description "Final selects for client delivery"
```

Create with JSON output:

```bash
maki col create "Travel" --json
```

### SEE ALSO

[collection add](#maki-collection-add) -- add assets to a collection.
[collection show](#maki-collection-show) -- view collection contents.
[search](04-retrieve-commands.md#maki-search) -- `collection:` filter for searching within a collection.

---

## maki collection list

### NAME

maki-collection-list -- list all collections

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] collection list
```

Alias: `maki col list`

### DESCRIPTION

Lists all collections in the catalog, showing each collection's name, description (if any), and the number of assets it contains.

### ARGUMENTS

None.

### OPTIONS

This command only accepts [global flags](00-cli-conventions.md#global-flags).

`--json` outputs an array of collection objects.

### EXAMPLES

List all collections:

```bash
maki collection list
```

List collections as JSON and extract names:

```bash
maki col list --json | jq '.[].name'
```

Displays the assets belonging to a collection. Output format can be customized using the same format presets and template syntax as `maki search`.

### ARGUMENTS

**NAME** (required)
: The name of the collection to display.

### OPTIONS

**--format \<FMT\>**
: Output format. Presets: `ids`, `short` (default), `full`, `json`. Custom templates use `{placeholder}` syntax (e.g., `'{id}\t{name}'`).

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] saved-search save <NAME> <QUERY> [--sort <SORT>] [--favorite]
```

Alias: `maki ss save`

### DESCRIPTION

Saves a search query under a name for later re-use. Saved searches are stored in `searches.toml` at the catalog root and function as smart albums -- the results update dynamically as the catalog changes.

If a saved search with the same name already exists, it is replaced.

Saved searches appear as clickable chips in the web UI browse page and can be executed from the CLI with `maki saved-search run`.

### ARGUMENTS

**NAME** (required)
: A name for the saved search.

**QUERY** (required)
: The search query string, using the same syntax as `maki search`.

### OPTIONS

**--sort \<SORT\>**
: Sort order for results. Values: `date_desc` (default), `date_asc`, `name_asc`, `name_desc`, `size_asc`, `size_desc`.

**--favorite**
: Mark the saved search as a favorite. Favorite searches are shown prominently as chips on the web UI browse page.

`--json` outputs the saved search entry.

### EXAMPLES

Save a search for highly-rated landscapes:

```bash
maki saved-search save "Best Landscapes" "tag:landscape rating:4+"
```

Save with a custom sort order:

```bash
maki ss save "Recent Videos" "type:video" --sort date_desc
```

Save a search using quoted filter values:

```bash
maki ss save "Canon Portraits" 'camera:"Canon EOS R5" tag:portrait'

## maki stack create

### NAME

maki-stack-create -- create a new stack from the given assets

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] stack create <ASSET_IDS...>
```

Alias: `maki st create`

### DESCRIPTION

Creates a new stack from two or more assets. Stacks are lightweight anonymous groups for visually related images -- burst shots, bracketing sequences, similar scenes. The first asset ID becomes the stack's "pick" (displayed in the browse grid).

Each asset can belong to at most one stack. Attempting to stack an asset that is already in a stack produces an error.

Stacks are persisted in `stacks.yaml` at the catalog root and restored during `rebuild-catalog`.

### ARGUMENTS

**ASSET_IDS** (required)
: Two or more asset IDs. The first ID becomes the pick (position 0).

### OPTIONS

This command only accepts [global flags](00-cli-conventions.md#global-flags).

`--json` outputs the created stack's details (id, member_count, asset_ids).

### EXAMPLES

Create a stack from three burst shots (first becomes pick):

```bash
maki stack create a1b2c3d4-... e5f67890-... f1a2b3c4-...
```

Create using the alias with JSON output:

```bash
maki st create a1b2c3d4-... e5f67890-... --json
```

### SEE ALSO

[stack add](#maki-stack-add) -- add assets to an existing stack.
[stack pick](#maki-stack-pick) -- change which asset is the pick.
[stack dissolve](#maki-stack-dissolve) -- dissolve a stack entirely.

---

## maki stack add

### NAME

maki-stack-add -- add assets to an existing stack

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] stack add <REFERENCE> <ASSET_IDS...>
```

Alias: `maki st add`

### DESCRIPTION

Adds one or more assets to an existing stack. The reference asset identifies which stack to add to -- it must already be a member of a stack. New assets are appended to the end of the stack's member list.

Assets that are already in a stack (any stack) cannot be added and will produce an error.

### ARGUMENTS

**REFERENCE** (required)
: Any asset ID that is already in the target stack.

**ASSET_IDS** (required)
: One or more asset IDs to add to the stack.

### OPTIONS

This command only accepts [global flags](00-cli-conventions.md#global-flags).

`--json` outputs `{"added": N}` with the count of assets added.

### EXAMPLES

Add an asset to the stack containing a1b2c3d4:

```bash
maki stack add a1b2c3d4-... new-asset-id-...
```

Add multiple assets:

```bash
maki st add a1b2c3d4-... b2c3d4e5-... c3d4e5f6-...
```

### SEE ALSO

[stack create](#maki-stack-create) -- create a new stack.
[stack remove](#maki-stack-remove) -- remove assets from a stack.

---

## maki stack remove

### NAME

maki-stack-remove -- remove assets from their stack

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] stack remove <ASSET_IDS...>
```

Alias: `maki st remove`

### DESCRIPTION

Removes one or more assets from their stacks. Each asset is removed from whatever stack it belongs to. If removing an asset causes a stack to have fewer than 2 members, the stack is automatically dissolved.

Assets not currently in a stack are silently skipped.

### ARGUMENTS

**ASSET_IDS** (required)
: One or more asset IDs to remove from their stacks.

### OPTIONS

This command only accepts [global flags](00-cli-conventions.md#global-flags).

`--json` outputs `{"removed": N}` with the count of assets removed.

### EXAMPLES

Remove a single asset from its stack:

```bash
maki stack remove a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

Remove multiple assets:

```bash
maki st remove a1b2c3d4-... e5f67890-...

## maki stack pick

### NAME

maki-stack-pick -- set the pick (top) of a stack

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] stack pick <ASSET_ID>
```

Alias: `maki st pick`

### DESCRIPTION

Promotes an asset to position 0 (the "pick") of its stack. The pick is the asset shown in the browse grid when stacks are collapsed. The asset must already be a member of a stack.

### ARGUMENTS

**ASSET_ID** (required)
: The asset ID to make the pick. Must be in a stack.

### OPTIONS

This command only accepts [global flags](00-cli-conventions.md#global-flags).

### ARGUMENTS

**ASSET_ID** (required)
: Any asset ID that belongs to a stack.

### OPTIONS

**--format \<FMT\>**
: Output format. Presets: `ids`, `short` (default), `full`, `json`. Custom templates use `{placeholder}` syntax.

## maki stack from-tag

### NAME

maki-stack-from-tag -- convert matching tags into stacks

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] stack from-tag <PATTERN> [--remove-tags] [--apply]
```

Alias: `maki st from-tag`

### DESCRIPTION

Finds assets whose tags match a pattern containing a `{}` wildcard, groups them by the wildcard value, and creates a stack from each group. This automates the common workflow of converting tag-based groupings (e.g., from CaptureOne or Lightroom) into maki stacks.

Without `--apply`, runs in **report-only mode** showing what stacks would be created. With `--apply`, creates the stacks. With `--remove-tags`, the matched tag is removed from **every asset that carries it** — including orphan tags (single-asset tags that can't form a stack) and already-stacked assets. This makes `--remove-tags` a true cleanup flag for post-migration tag removal.

### ARGUMENTS

**PATTERN** (required)
: A tag pattern with `{}` as a wildcard placeholder. For example, `"Aperture Stack {}"` matches tags like "Aperture Stack 1", "Aperture Stack 2", etc.

### OPTIONS

**--remove-tags**
: Remove the matched tag from every asset that carries it, including orphans and already-stacked assets. Only effective with `--apply`. Useful for cleaning up leftover tags after a partial migration — re-run with `--remove-tags` to sweep up tags that earlier runs left behind.

**--apply**
: Actually create stacks. Without this flag, the command only reports what it would do.

### EXAMPLES

Preview what stacks would be created from aperture stack tags:

```bash
maki stack from-tag "Aperture Stack {}"
```

Create stacks and remove the grouping tags:

```bash
maki st from-tag "Aperture Stack {}" --remove-tags --apply
```

Create stacks from bracket sequence tags:

```bash
maki stack from-tag "Bracket {}" --apply
```

### SEE ALSO

## maki faces detect *(Pro)* {#maki-faces-detect}

### NAME

maki-faces-detect -- detect faces in asset images

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] faces detect [--query <Q>] [--asset <id>] [--volume <label>] [--apply]
```

### DESCRIPTION

Detects faces in asset preview images using the YuNet ONNX model. For each detected face, computes a 512-dimensional ArcFace embedding and generates a 150×150 JPEG crop thumbnail.

Without `--apply`, runs in report-only mode showing how many faces would be detected. With `--apply`, stores face records in the catalog and generates crop thumbnails.

Requires at least one scope filter (`--query`, `--asset`, or `--volume`) to prevent accidental full-catalog processing. Models must be downloaded first with `maki faces download`.

### OPTIONS

**--query \<Q\>**
: Search query to scope which assets are processed.

**--asset \<id\>**
: Process a single asset by ID.

**--volume \<label\>**
: Process assets on a specific volume.

**--min-confidence \<FLOAT\>**
: Minimum detection confidence threshold (0.0–1.0, default 0.5). Faces below this confidence are discarded.

**--apply**
: Actually store detected faces (default is dry run).

**--force**
: Re-detect faces even if faces already exist for an asset. Without this flag, assets with existing face records are skipped.

`--json`, `--log`, `--time` for output control.

### EXAMPLES

Detect faces in all images (dry run):

```bash
maki faces detect --query "type:image"
```

Detect and store faces for a single asset:

```bash
maki faces detect --asset a1b2c3d4 --apply
```

Detect faces on a specific volume with logging:

```bash
maki faces detect --volume "Photos" --apply --log
```

### SEE ALSO

[faces cluster](#maki-faces-cluster) -- group detected faces into people.
[faces download](#maki-faces-download) -- download required models.

## maki faces cluster *(Pro)* {#maki-faces-cluster}

### NAME

maki-faces-cluster -- group similar faces into people

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] faces cluster [--query <Q>] [--asset <id>] [--volume <label>]
                                  [--threshold <F>] [--min-confidence <F>] [--apply]
```

### DESCRIPTION

Groups similar face embeddings into unnamed person groups using **agglomerative hierarchical clustering with average linkage** (UPGMA). This is order-independent and produces tighter, better-separated clusters than simpler greedy approaches. Faces already assigned to a person are skipped.

The threshold is the minimum average cosine similarity for two clusters to merge (0.0–1.0, higher = stricter). Default is **0.35**, configurable via `[ai] face_cluster_threshold` in `maki.toml`. The default is tuned for the aligned FP32 ArcFace pipeline where intra-person similarity typically falls in 0.5–0.9 and inter-person similarity is near zero or negative.

The `--min-confidence` flag filters out low-quality face detections (blurry, profile, partial) whose noisy embeddings hurt cluster purity. Default is **0.7**, configurable via `[ai] face_min_confidence`.

Only faces embedded with the **current** recognition model are clustered. If older embeddings from a previous model version exist, the command prints a warning listing how many were skipped — those assets need `maki faces detect --force` to be re-embedded.

Without `--apply`, shows a dry-run report of cluster sizes. With `--apply`, creates person records and assigns faces.

### OPTIONS

**--query \<Q\>**
: Scope clustering to faces on assets matching this query.

**--asset \<id\>**
: Scope clustering to faces on a single asset.

**--volume \<label\>**
: Scope clustering to faces on assets on a specific volume.

**--threshold \<F\>**
: Similarity threshold for clustering (default 0.35).

**--min-confidence \<F\>**
: Skip face detections whose confidence is below this value (default 0.7).

**--apply**
: Actually create person groups (default is dry run).

`--json`, `--log`, `--time` for output control.

### TUNING THE THRESHOLD

The right threshold depends on your dataset. Use `maki faces similarity` to see your embedding distribution, then pick a threshold in the valley between the inter-person and intra-person humps.

| Threshold | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `0.3`     | Aggressive merging — bigger clusters, may mix similar-looking people |
| `0.35` (default) | Balanced — usually a good starting point |
| `0.45`    | Conservative — tighter clusters, more singletons/small groups |
| `0.6+`    | Very strict — mostly splits same-person photos into separate clusters |

Start with a dry run at the default, eyeball the cluster sizes, and adjust.

### EXAMPLES

Preview clustering results:

```bash
maki faces cluster
```

Apply clustering with a stricter threshold:

```bash
maki faces cluster --threshold 0.45 --apply
```

Cluster only faces from a specific shoot:

```bash
maki faces cluster --query "path:Capture/2026-03" --apply
```

Use a higher confidence filter to skip profile/blurry faces:

```bash
maki faces cluster --min-confidence 0.85 --apply
```

```

### DESCRIPTION

Deletes face records that have no person assigned (`person_id IS NULL`). Useful for:

- Cleaning up after experimenting with clustering thresholds.
- Removing stale embeddings after a recognition-model upgrade — old embeddings sit idle, and this command sweeps them up before you re-detect with the new model.
- Dropping orphan faces left behind after `faces delete-person`.

Assigned faces (already part of a named or unnamed person cluster) are untouched.

Without `--apply`, reports how many faces would be deleted. With `--apply`, performs the deletion.

### OPTIONS

**--apply**
: Actually delete the faces (default is dry run).

### EXAMPLES

```bash
maki faces clean                 # how many orphans are there?
maki faces clean --apply         # delete them all
```

### SEE ALSO

[faces cluster](#maki-faces-cluster) -- group faces into people.
[faces delete-person](#maki-faces-delete-person) -- remove a person (unassigns their faces, which this command can then clean up).

## maki faces similarity *(Pro)* {#maki-faces-similarity}

### NAME

maki-faces-similarity -- analyze face embedding distribution

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] faces similarity [--query <Q>] [--asset <id>] [--volume <label>]
                                     [--min-confidence <F>] [--top <N>] [--all]
```

### DESCRIPTION

Diagnostic command. Computes all pairwise cosine similarities between faces in the given scope and prints:

- **Percentile statistics**: min, p10, p25, median, mean, p75, p90, p95, p99, max.
- **Histogram**: 10 buckets spanning the min–max range, each showing how many pairs fall into that similarity range.

Interpreting the histogram:

- **Bimodal (two clear humps)** — healthy embeddings. The lower hump is inter-person pairs (different people), the upper hump is intra-person pairs (same person). A good clustering threshold sits in the valley between them.
- **Single hump or narrow band** — embeddings are not discriminating well. Check that detection confidence is high enough, face crops are large enough, and the recognition model matches expectations.

With `--top N`, also prints each face's top-N nearest neighbors (face_id/asset_id/similarity) so you can spot-check whether a face's closest matches are actually the same person. This is invaluable for understanding clustering results.

### OPTIONS

**--query \<Q\>**, **--asset \<id\>**, **--volume \<label\>**
: Scope the analysis.

**--min-confidence \<F\>**
: Ignore face detections with confidence below this value (default 0.0 — include all).

**--top \<N\>**
: For each face, list its top-N nearest neighbors with similarity scores (default 0 — summary only).

**--all**
: Include already-assigned faces (default: only unassigned).

### EXAMPLES

Summary of unassigned refugee portraits:

```bash
maki faces similarity --query 'tag:"person|refugee"' --min-confidence 0.7
```

Per-face nearest neighbors to spot-check clustering:

```bash
maki faces similarity --query 'tag:"person|refugee"' --top 5
```

Include already-named people to see intra-cluster consistency:

```bash
maki faces similarity --query 'tag:"person|refugee"' --all
```

## maki faces dump-aligned *(Pro)* {#maki-faces-dump-aligned}

### NAME

maki-faces-dump-aligned -- save aligned 112×112 face crops for visual debugging

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] faces dump-aligned [--query <Q>] [--asset <id>]
                                       [--output <DIR>] [--limit <N>]
```

### DESCRIPTION

Detects faces on the fly and saves the resulting 112×112 ArcFace-aligned crops to disk. Used to verify that the alignment pipeline (5-point landmark similarity transform) is producing the crops the recognition model expects.

Healthy output: all crops at roughly the same face scale, eyes approximately level, face filling most of the 112×112 frame. If crops look mirrored, rotated, squashed, or offset, alignment math is wrong (or landmarks from the detector have an unexpected order).

Uses the same image-resolution path as `faces detect` — smart preview → regular preview → original file on an online volume.

### OPTIONS

**--query \<Q\>**, **--asset \<id\>**
: Scope which assets to process.

**--output \<DIR\>**
: Output directory (default: `./aligned-faces`).

**--limit \<N\>**
: Maximum number of crops to save (default 20, 0 = unlimited).

### EXAMPLES

```bash
maki faces dump-aligned --query 'tag:"person|refugee"' --limit 30
```

## maki faces delete-person *(Pro)*

### NAME

maki-faces-delete-person -- delete a person

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] faces delete-person <PERSON_ID>
```

### DESCRIPTION

Deletes a person record. All faces assigned to this person become unassigned (they are not deleted).

### ARGUMENTS

**PERSON_ID** (required)
: The person's UUID.

### EXAMPLES

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] faces unassign <FACE_ID>
```

### DESCRIPTION

Removes the person assignment from a single face. The face record is preserved; only the person link is cleared.

### ARGUMENTS

**FACE_ID** (required)
: The face's UUID.

### EXAMPLES

```bash
maki faces unassign a1b2c3d4-...

---

## maki faces export *(Pro)*

### NAME

maki-faces-export -- export faces and people to YAML and binary files

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] faces export
```

### DESCRIPTION

Exports all face and people data from the SQLite catalog to file-based storage:

- `faces.yaml` — face records (bounding boxes, confidence, person assignments)
- `people.yaml` — people records (names, representative faces)
- `embeddings/arcface/<prefix>/<face_id>.bin` — ArcFace face recognition embeddings as raw binary files

This is a one-time migration command for catalogs that have existing face data in SQLite but no corresponding YAML/binary files (i.e., data created before v2.2.1). After running this command, `rebuild-catalog` will be able to restore face and people data.

Going forward, all face/people write operations automatically persist to both SQLite and files.

### EXAMPLES

Export all face data:

```bash
maki faces export
```

Export with JSON output:

```bash
maki faces export --json
```

### SEE ALSO

[faces detect](#maki-faces-detect) -- detect faces in images.
[rebuild-catalog](05-maintain-commands.md#maki-rebuild-catalog) -- rebuilds catalog from files.

## maki faces download *(Pro)* {#maki-faces-download}

### NAME

maki-faces-download -- download face detection models

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] faces download
```

### DESCRIPTION

Downloads the YuNet face detection model (~230 KB) and ArcFace ResNet-100 FP32 face recognition model (~261 MB) from HuggingFace. Models are cached in `~/.maki/models/faces/` by default, configurable via `[ai] model_dir` in `maki.toml`.

The recognition model has normalization nodes baked into its ONNX graph; the pipeline passes raw pixel values and lets the model apply its own mean/std. Faces are aligned to a canonical 112×112 template using a 5-point similarity transform before embedding, matching how ArcFace was trained.

### EXAMPLES

```bash
maki faces download
```

---

## maki faces status *(Pro)*

### NAME

maki-faces-status -- show face detection model status

### SYNOPSIS

```
maki [GLOBAL FLAGS] faces status
```

### DESCRIPTION

Shows the download status of face models and the breakdown of stored face embeddings by recognition model. If the current recognition model differs from the one used for some stored embeddings (e.g., after upgrading), the command prints how many faces are "stale" and prompts you to re-run `maki faces detect --force` to re-embed them. Stale embeddings are silently skipped by clustering.

### EXAMPLES

```bash
maki faces status
```

Typical output after an upgrade:

```
Face model directory: /Users/jane/.maki/models/faces
Models downloaded: yes
Current recognition model: arcface-resnet100-fp32-aligned-v2
Total faces detected: 387
Total people: 4
Faces by recognition model:
  arcface-resnet100-fp32-aligned-v2: 349 (current)
  arcface-resnet100-int8: 38
  38 face(s) use a different recognition model and will be
  ignored by clustering. Re-run `maki faces detect --force` to update.
```
