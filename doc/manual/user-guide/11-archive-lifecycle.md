# The Archive Lifecycle

Most photography tools focus on individual tasks — importing, tagging, exporting. But the harder challenge is the long game: managing a growing library across multiple drives over years and decades. This chapter ties together the commands you've learned into a coherent storage strategy.

---

## The Big Picture

Files in a well-managed library flow through a predictable lifecycle. Each stage has a different purpose, and MAKI provides tools for every transition:

```mermaid {width=52%}
flowchart TD
    IM["Import<br/><i>maki import</i>"]
    WK["Working Drive<br/>(fast SSD)"]
    CU["Cull & Organize<br/><i>rate, tag, stack</i>"]
    AR["Archive Drive<br/>(long-term storage)"]
    BK["Backup Drive<br/>(redundancy copy)"]
    VE["Verify & Maintain<br/><i>maki verify</i><br/><i>maki backup-status</i>"]
    EX["Export & Deliver<br/><i>maki export</i><br/><i>maki contact-sheet</i>"]

    IM --> WK
    WK --> CU
    CU --> AR
    CU --> EX
    AR --> BK
    BK --> VE
    VE --> AR
```

The flow is:

1. **Import** new files onto a fast working drive
2. **Cull and organize** while files are easily accessible
3. **Archive** completed work to reliable long-term storage
4. **Back up** the archive to a second (or third) drive
5. **Verify and maintain** on a regular schedule
6. **Export and deliver** from any stage

Each MAKI volume can be assigned a **purpose** (`working`, `archive`, `backup`, `cloud`) that reflects its role in this lifecycle. These purposes drive `maki backup-status` and `maki duplicates` analysis. See [Volume Purposes](02-setup.md#volume-purposes) for setup details.

---

## Stage 1: Import to Working Storage

A fast local SSD is the ideal landing zone for new files. Speed matters during import, culling, and preview generation.

```bash
# Register the working drive
maki volume add "Work SSD" /Volumes/FastSSD --purpose working

# Import a shoot
maki import /Volumes/FastSSD/Capture/2026-03-15/ --auto-group --smart --log
```

The `--smart` flag generates high-resolution previews (2560px) alongside regular thumbnails, enabling zoom and pan in the web UI even after the files move to a slower drive.

**Tip:** Use `--add-tag` to stamp each import session for easy retrieval later:

```bash
maki import /Volumes/Card/DCIM --add-tag "shoot:johnson-wedding" --auto-group --log
```

---

## Stage 2: Cull and Organize

While files are on fast storage, do your creative work: rate, tag, describe, and build collections. This is the stage covered in [Organizing Assets](04-organize.md) and [Organizing & Culling](10-organizing-and-culling.md).

A typical post-import session:

```bash
# Start the web UI for visual culling
maki serve

# Or from the CLI:
# 1. Auto-group RAW+JPEG pairs
maki auto-group --apply

# 2. Tag obvious rejects
maki search -q "path:Capture/2026-03-15 -rating:1+" | xargs -I{} maki tag {} rest

# 3. Build a collection from selects
maki search -q "tag:johnson-wedding rating:4+" | xargs maki col add "Johnson Wedding Selects"
```

Don't rush this stage. Files on the working drive are fast to browse and easy to revisit. Move to archive only when you're satisfied with your curation.

---

## Stage 3: Archive Completed Work

Once a shoot or project is fully culled and organized, move it to long-term archive storage. This frees space on your working SSD while preserving everything in the catalog.

```bash
# Register the archive drive
maki volume add "Archive 2026" /Volumes/ArchiveDrive --purpose archive

# Preview the migration
maki relocate --query "tag:johnson-wedding" --target "Archive 2026" --dry-run

# Execute: copy files to archive
maki relocate --query "tag:johnson-wedding" --target "Archive 2026" --log

# After confirming the archive copy, free the working drive
maki relocate --query "tag:johnson-wedding volume:Work SSD" --target "Archive 2026" --remove-source --log
```

**Important:** Don't use `--remove-source` in the first pass. Copy first, verify, then remove the source in a second pass. This gives you a safety window.

After archiving, the files appear on both volumes during the transition. The working drive copy is removed only when you explicitly pass `--remove-source`.

---

## Stage 4: Create Backup Copies

An archive is only as good as its backup. Copy your archived files to a physically separate drive:

```bash
# Register the backup drive
maki volume add "Backup A" /Volumes/BackupDisk --purpose backup

# Copy the entire archive to the backup
maki relocate --query "volume:Archive 2026" --target "Backup A" --log
```

Note: `relocate` without `--remove-source` copies files — the originals stay on the archive drive. This is intentional: you now have two copies.

### The 3-2-1 rule

A solid backup strategy follows the 3-2-1 rule: **3 copies** of your data, on **2 different media types**, with **1 copy offsite**. With MAKI:

- **3 copies:** working + archive + backup (or archive + backup A + backup B)
- **2 media types:** SSD working drive + HDD archive + HDD backup
- **1 offsite:** A backup drive stored at a different physical location, or a `cloud` volume

Use `--min-copies` to enforce your policy:

```bash
# Check that every asset has at least 2 copies
maki backup-status --min-copies 2 --at-risk

# Stricter: require 3 copies for rated images
maki backup-status --min-copies 3 --at-risk -q "rating:1+"
```

---

## Stage 5: Verify and Maintain

Storage devices degrade silently. A file that reads fine today may return corrupted data tomorrow. Regular verification catches problems while you still have good copies elsewhere.

### Monthly routine

```bash
# Verify the archive drive (skip files checked within 30 days)
maki verify --volume "Archive 2026" --max-age 30 --log

# Check backup coverage
maki backup-status --at-risk

# Clean up any stale records
maki cleanup --apply
```

### After reconnecting an offline drive

When you reconnect a backup or archive drive that's been offline, run the full maintenance sequence:

```bash
# 1. Verify file integrity
maki verify --volume "Backup A" --time

# 2. Push pending MAKI edits to XMP files
maki writeback --volume "Backup A"

# 3. Pick up external recipe changes
maki refresh --volume "Backup A"

# 4. Reconcile moved/renamed files
maki sync /Volumes/BackupDisk/ --apply

# 5. Clean up stale records
maki cleanup --volume "Backup A" --apply

# 6. Check for accidental duplicates
maki duplicates --same-volume --volume "Backup A"
```

### Monitoring long-term health

Use saved searches and `stats` to keep an eye on your library:

```bash
# Save a search for single-copy assets (at risk)
maki ss save "At Risk" "copies:1" --favorite

# Save a search for assets not verified in 90 days
maki ss save "Stale" "stale:90" --favorite

# Overview of your storage
maki stats --volumes
```

---

## Stage 6: Export and Deliver

At any point in the lifecycle, you can export files for delivery, sharing, or printing — regardless of which volume holds the originals (as long as it's online):

```bash
# Client delivery as ZIP
maki export "collection:Johnson Wedding Selects" delivery.zip --zip

# Contact sheet for review
maki contact-sheet "collection:Johnson Wedding Selects" proofs.pdf \
  --title "Johnson Wedding" --copyright "Jane Doe Photography"

# Full export with sidecars for handoff to another tool
maki export "tag:johnson-wedding" /Volumes/USB/handoff --layout mirror --include-sidecars
```

---

## Putting It All Together: A Photographer's Monthly Workflow

Here is a concrete example of how these stages play out over a typical month:

### Week 1–2: Shoot and import

```bash
# Import each shoot with a descriptive tag
maki import /Volumes/Card/DCIM --add-tag "shoot:corporate-2026-03" --auto-group --smart --log
maki import /Volumes/Card/DCIM --add-tag "shoot:landscape-spring" --auto-group --smart --log
```

### Week 2–3: Cull and deliver

```bash
# Cull in the web UI, rate keepers, tag rejects as "rest"
maki serve

# Export selects for client
maki export "tag:corporate-2026-03 rating:4+" /tmp/delivery/ --zip
maki contact-sheet "tag:corporate-2026-03 rating:3+" proofs.pdf --title "Corporate Event"
```

### Week 4: Archive and back up

```bash
# Move completed shoots to archive
maki relocate --query "tag:corporate-2026-03" --target "Archive 2026" --log
maki relocate --query "tag:landscape-spring" --target "Archive 2026" --log

# Remove from working drive after confirming archive
maki relocate --query "tag:corporate-2026-03 volume:Work SSD" --target "Archive 2026" --remove-source
maki relocate --query "tag:landscape-spring volume:Work SSD" --target "Archive 2026" --remove-source

# Back up new archive content
maki relocate --query "volume:Archive 2026 copies:1" --target "Backup A" --log

# Verify and check coverage
maki verify --volume "Archive 2026" --max-age 30
maki backup-status --at-risk
```

### Result

After one month:
- Working SSD is clean, ready for next month's shoots
- Archive drive holds all culled and organized work
- Backup drive has a copy of everything on the archive
- `maki backup-status` confirms no at-risk assets
- All metadata, tags, ratings, and collections travel with the files via YAML sidecars

## When Things Go Wrong

Drives fail. It's not a question of if, but when. See [Recovering from a Drive Failure](07-maintenance.md#recovering-from-a-drive-failure) for a step-by-step recovery playbook.

The best defense is prevention: regular verification, backup coverage checks, and the discipline of always having at least two copies of every file you care about.
