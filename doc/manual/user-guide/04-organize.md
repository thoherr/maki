# Organizing Assets

Once your files are [imported](03-ingest.md), dam provides several tools for
organizing them: tags, metadata editing, variant grouping, static collections,
and saved searches. All changes are persisted in both the SQLite catalog and
YAML sidecar files. When `.xmp` recipe files are present, edits to ratings,
tags, descriptions, and color labels are written back to disk for bidirectional
sync with tools like CaptureOne and Lightroom.

---

## Tags

Tags are free-form keywords attached to an asset. They are deduplicated
automatically -- tags from XMP sidecar files, embedded XMP in JPEGs, and
manual additions are merged into a single set.

### Hierarchical tags

Tags can contain `/` as a hierarchy separator, allowing you to organize
keywords into a tree structure:

```
dam tag a1b2c3d4 animals/birds/eagles
dam tag a1b2c3d4 location/europe/germany
```

Parent tag searches match all descendants -- searching for `tag:animals` will
find assets tagged `animals/birds/eagles`. This works in both CLI and web UI
searches.

Hierarchical tags interoperate with Lightroom's `lr:hierarchicalSubject` XMP
field. When importing XMP files that contain `lr:hierarchicalSubject` entries,
dam reads the hierarchy and stores the full path as a tag. Write-back preserves
the hierarchy in the XMP file.

The tags page in the web UI displays hierarchical tags as a collapsible tree
(see [Web UI](06-web-ui.md) for details).

### Adding tags

Pass one or more tag names after the asset ID:

```
dam tag a1b2c3d4 landscape nature golden-hour
```

This adds three tags to the asset. If a tag already exists on the asset, it is
silently skipped.

### Removing tags

Use the `--remove` flag:

```
dam tag a1b2c3d4 --remove unwanted blurry
```

Tags that are not present on the asset are silently ignored.

### XMP write-back

When an asset has `.xmp` recipe files on disk, tag changes are written back
immediately. Added tags are inserted into the `dc:subject` / `rdf:Bag` block;
removed tags are deleted from it. Tags that were added independently in
CaptureOne or Lightroom (not managed by dam) are preserved -- dam operates on
deltas, not full replacement.

If the volume containing the `.xmp` file is offline, the write-back is skipped
with a warning.

### Browsing tags in the web UI

The web UI provides a dedicated tags page at `/tags` with:

- **Sortable columns** -- click the Name or Count header to sort ascending or
  descending.
- **Live text filter** -- type 2 or more characters to filter the tag list
  in real time.
- **Multi-column layout** -- adapts to the viewport width using CSS columns.

Clicking a tag name navigates to the browse page filtered to that tag.

---

## Editing Metadata

The `dam edit` command sets or clears first-class metadata fields on an asset.
At least one flag is required.

### Setting fields

```
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --name "Sunset at Beach"
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --description "A beautiful sunset over the Pacific coast"
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --rating 5
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --label Red
```

Multiple flags can be combined in a single invocation:

```
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --name "Sunset at Beach" --rating 5 --label Orange
```

### Clearing fields

Each field has a corresponding `--clear-*` flag:

```
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --clear-name
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --clear-description
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --clear-rating
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --clear-label
```

An empty description string is normalized to a clear operation -- these two
commands are equivalent:

```
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --description ""
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --clear-description
```

### Color labels

The label field accepts one of seven colors: **Red**, **Orange**, **Yellow**,
**Green**, **Blue**, **Pink**, **Purple**. Input is case-insensitive and stored
in canonical title-case:

```
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --label red      # stored as "Red"
dam edit a1b2c3d4 --label YELLOW   # stored as "Yellow"
```

This is a superset of Lightroom's 5-color palette, matching CaptureOne's 7
colors.

### XMP write-back for metadata

Changes to **rating**, **description**, and **color label** are automatically
written back to any `.xmp` recipe files attached to the asset. This enables
round-trip editing with external tools:

1. Rate an image in dam (`dam edit ... --rating 4`).
2. Open CaptureOne -- the rating is already reflected in the XMP sidecar.
3. Change the rating in CaptureOne.
4. Run `dam refresh` to pick up the change.

### Structured output

Use the global `--json` flag for machine-readable output:

```
dam --json edit a1b2c3d4 --rating 5
```

---

## Manual Grouping

The `dam group` command merges multiple variants (identified by their content
hashes) into a single asset. This is useful when related files were imported
separately and ended up as distinct assets.

### Basic usage

```
dam group abc123def456 789fed321cba
```

You can pass any number of content hashes. dam identifies the assets that own
those variants and merges them.

### Merge rules

- The **oldest asset** (by `created_at`) is chosen as the target.
- Donor variants that had the **Original** role are re-roled to **Export**
  (in both the YAML sidecar and the SQLite catalog) to avoid multiple
  originals on one asset.
- **Tags** from donor assets are merged into the target (union, deduplicated).
- **Recipes** from donor assets are moved to the target.
- Donor assets are **deleted** after merging.

### Finding content hashes

Use `dam show` to display an asset's variants and their content hashes:

```
dam show a1b2c3d4
```

Or use `dam search --format '{id}\t{name}'` to locate the assets first, then
inspect them with `dam show`.

---

## Auto-Grouping

The `dam auto-group` command finds assets that belong together by matching
their filename stems across the catalog. This handles the common case where a
RAW original and its processed exports end up as separate assets -- for
example, when CaptureOne exports land in a different directory from the
originals.

### Report mode (dry run)

Without `--apply`, auto-group runs in report-only mode. Nothing is modified:

```
dam auto-group
```

Output shows which groups would be formed, how many donors would be merged, and
how many variants would be moved.

### Applying changes

```
dam auto-group --apply
```

### Scoping to a search query

Pass a search query to limit the scope:

```
dam auto-group "tag:landscape" --apply
dam auto-group "path:Capture/2024" --apply
```

### The matching algorithm

Auto-group uses fuzzy prefix matching with separator-boundary detection:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Collect filename stems from assets] --> B[Sort stems by length, shortest first]
    B --> C[For each stem, find shortest existing root\nthat is a prefix match]
    C --> D{Shorter stem is prefix\nof longer stem?}
    D -- No --> E[Register as new root]
    D -- Yes --> F{Next character in\nlonger string?}
    F -- "Non-alphanumeric\n(separator: - _ space ( )" --> G[Match: assign to root's group]
    F -- "Alphanumeric\n(continuation)" --> E
    E --> H[Group assets by resolved root stem]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Filter to groups with 2+ assets]
    I --> J[Select target per group:\n1. Prefer asset with RAW variant\n2. Oldest by created_at]
    J --> K[Merge donor variants into target\nre-role Original to Export]
```

**Matching examples:**

| Shorter stem | Longer stem | Next char | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Z91_8561` | `Z91_8561-1-HighRes` | `-` (hyphen) | Match |
| `Z91_8561` | `Z91_8561_edit` | `_` (underscore) | Match |
| `DSC_001` | `DSC_0010` | `0` (digit) | No match |
| `IMG_2000` | `IMG_2000 (1)` | ` ` (space) | Match |

**Chain resolution:** When multiple stems form a chain, they all resolve to
the shortest root. For example, `Z91_8561`, `Z91_8561-1`, and
`Z91_8561-1-HighRes` all group under `Z91_8561`.

**Target selection:** Within each group, the target asset is the one with a RAW
variant (if any), breaking ties by oldest `created_at` timestamp. Donor
variants with the Original role are re-roled to Export, just like manual
grouping.

### Output options

```
dam auto-group --json            # structured JSON result
dam auto-group --log --apply     # per-group progress on stderr
```

### Web UI

In the web UI, select multiple assets on the browse page, then click the
**"Group by name"** button in the batch toolbar. A confirmation dialog shows
how many groups would be formed before applying.

---

## Collections (Static Albums)

Collections are manually curated lists of assets -- the equivalent of albums
in a traditional photo manager. They are backed by both SQLite (for fast
queries) and a `collections.yaml` file at the catalog root (which survives
`rebuild-catalog`).

The alias `dam col` can be used in place of `dam collection` for brevity.

### Creating a collection

```
dam collection create "Best of 2024" --description "Top picks from the year"
```

### Listing collections

```
dam collection list
```

### Viewing collection contents

```
dam collection show "Best of 2024"
dam collection show "Best of 2024" --format full
```

### Adding assets

```
dam collection add "Best of 2024" a1b2c3d4 e5f6a7b8
```

You can pipe asset IDs from a search:

```
dam search -q "rating:5 tag:landscape" | xargs dam col add "Best of 2024"
```

This is a powerful pattern -- combine any search filter to build a collection
in a single command.

### Removing assets

```
dam collection remove "Best of 2024" a1b2c3d4
```

### Deleting a collection

```
dam collection delete "Best of 2024"
```

This removes the collection definition and all membership records. The assets
themselves are not affected.

### Searching within a collection

Use the `collection:` filter in any search:

```
dam search "collection:\"Best of 2024\" rating:4+"
```

Note the quoted value for collection names with spaces.

### Web UI

- The **`/collections`** page lists all collections with a **"+ New Collection"**
  button.
- On the **asset detail page**, collection membership is shown as chips with
  a remove button.
- In the **batch toolbar**, a collection dropdown lets you add or remove
  selected assets from a collection. The dropdown includes a **"New..."**
  option that creates a collection inline.

---

## Stacks

Stacks are lightweight anonymous groups of assets -- burst shots, exposure
brackets, or similar scenes that you want to collapse into a single entry in the
browse grid. Unlike grouping (which permanently merges variants into one asset),
stacks keep each asset independent. You can dissolve a stack at any time to
separate the assets again.

Each asset can belong to at most one stack. Members are position-ordered;
position 0 is the **pick** -- the representative image shown when the stack is
collapsed in the browse grid. Stacks auto-dissolve when they have one or fewer
members.

The alias `dam st` can be used in place of `dam stack` for brevity.

### Creating a stack

Pass two or more asset IDs to create a new stack:

```
dam stack create a1b2c3d4 e5f6a7b8 c9d0e1f2
```

The first asset becomes the pick (position 0). The remaining assets are ordered
by their position in the argument list.

### Adding assets to a stack

```
dam stack add <stack-id> f3a4b5c6
```

The new asset is appended to the end of the stack.

### Setting the pick

Promote any member to the pick position:

```
dam stack pick <stack-id> e5f6a7b8
```

The previous pick moves to position 1; all other positions shift accordingly.

### Removing assets from a stack

```
dam stack remove <stack-id> c9d0e1f2
```

If the stack has one or fewer members after removal, it auto-dissolves.

### Dissolving a stack

Dissolve a stack entirely, returning all members to standalone assets:

```
dam stack dissolve <stack-id>
```

### Listing stacks

```
dam stack list
```

Shows all stacks with their member counts.

### Showing stack details

```
dam stack show <stack-id>
```

Displays the stack's members in position order, with the pick marked.

### Searching for stacked assets

Use the `stacked:` filter in any search:

```
dam search "stacked:true"      # assets that are in a stack
dam search "stacked:false"     # standalone assets
```

### Structured output

All stack commands support `--json`:

```
dam --json stack list
dam --json stack show <stack-id>
```

### Web UI

See [Web UI](06-web-ui.md) for the stack experience in the browse grid, batch
operations, and asset detail page.

## Saved Searches (Smart Albums)

Saved searches are named queries stored in `searches.toml` at the catalog root.
Unlike collections, they are dynamic -- running a saved search always reflects
the current state of the catalog.

The alias `dam ss` can be used in place of `dam saved-search`.

### Saving a search

```
dam saved-search save "Landscapes" "tag:landscape rating:3+" --sort date_desc
```

This stores the query string and sort order under the name "Landscapes".

### Listing saved searches

```
dam saved-search list
```

### Running a saved search

```
dam saved-search run "Landscapes"
dam saved-search run "Landscapes" --format full
dam saved-search run "Landscapes" --format json
```

### Deleting a saved search

```
dam saved-search delete "Landscapes"
```

### Practical examples

Save commonly used filters for quick access:

```
dam ss save "Unrated"     "rating:0"
dam ss save "Five Stars"  "rating:5"
dam ss save "Red Label"   "label:Red"
dam ss save "Recent"      "path:Capture/2024" --sort date_desc
dam ss save "Orphans"     "orphan:true"
dam ss save "Theater"     "tag:\"Fools Theater\""
```

Combine saved searches with other commands:

```
dam ss run "Five Stars" --format ids | xargs dam col add "Portfolio"
```

### Web UI

- **Clickable chips** on the browse page load saved searches into the filter
  UI with a single click.
- The **Save button** captures the current search state (query, filters, sort
  order) as a new saved search.
- **Hover** over a chip to reveal rename and delete buttons.

---

## Putting It All Together

A typical organizing workflow after import might look like this:

1. **Auto-group** to merge related variants:
   ```
   dam auto-group --apply --log
   ```

2. **Tag** a batch of assets from the CLI:
   ```
   dam search -q "path:Capture/2024-08-15" | \
     xargs -I{} dam tag {} vacation beach
   ```

3. **Rate and label** standouts in the web UI using keyboard shortcuts
   (1-5 for ratings, r/o/y/g/b/p/u for labels).

4. **Build a collection** from your top picks:
   ```
   dam search -q "rating:5 tag:vacation" | xargs dam col add "Summer 2024"
   ```

5. **Save a smart search** for ongoing curation:
   ```
   dam ss save "Vacation Selects" "tag:vacation rating:4+" --sort date_desc
   ```
