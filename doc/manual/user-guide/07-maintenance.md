# Maintenance

Over time, files move, drives get swapped, external tools edit recipes, and storage devices accumulate stale references. This chapter covers the commands that keep your catalog accurate and your files healthy.

The core maintenance commands form a cycle:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    V["maki verify<br/>(detect corruption)"]
    S["maki sync<br/>(reconcile moved/<br/>modified files)"]
    SM["maki sync-metadata<br/>(bidirectional XMP sync<br/>with conflict detection)"]
    R["maki refresh<br/>(re-read changed recipes)"]
    W["maki writeback<br/>(write edits to XMP)"]
    C["maki cleanup<br/>(remove stale records)"]
    D["maki duplicates<br/>maki dedup<br/>(storage hygiene)"]

    V --> S
    S --> SM --> C
    S --> R --> W --> C
    S --> W --> R --> C
    C --> D --> V
```

After `sync`, there are two paths: `sync-metadata` handles both directions (reading recipe changes and writing back edits) in a single command with conflict detection. Alternatively, `refresh` and `writeback` can be run separately for finer control. After `cleanup`, the storage hygiene commands check for unwanted duplicates and verify backup coverage.

Each command is safe by default -- destructive operations require an explicit `--apply` flag, and most commands support `--dry-run` or report-only mode.


## Verification

`maki verify` re-hashes every file on disk and compares the result to the content hash stored in the catalog. This detects silent corruption, bit rot, and accidental modifications.

### Verify everything

```bash
maki verify
```

This walks all file locations on all online volumes. Offline volumes are skipped automatically.

Sample output:

```
Verify complete: 1847 verified, 2 modified, 0 FAILED, 3 skipped
```

### Verify specific files or directories

```bash
maki verify /Volumes/PhotosDrive/Capture/2026-02-01
```

Only files under the given path are checked.

### Limit to a volume

```bash
maki verify --volume "Photos 2024"
```

Useful when you reconnect a drive and want to spot-check it before trusting its contents.

### Verify a single asset

```bash
maki verify --asset a1b2c3d4
```

Asset IDs can be abbreviated to a unique prefix.

### Filter by file type

```bash
# Only verify RAW files
maki verify --include raw

# Skip audio files
maki verify --skip audio
```

### Two verification modes

**Catalog mode** (no paths): `maki verify` walks all file locations known to the catalog on online volumes. This checks whether your cataloged files are intact.

**Path mode** (with paths): `maki verify /some/path` scans files on disk and looks them up in the catalog. This also detects files that are not in the catalog at all.

### What the results mean

- **verified** -- file hash matches the catalog. The `verified_at` timestamp is updated.
- **modified** -- a recipe file (`.xmp`, `.cos`, etc.) was changed externally. maki updates the stored hash and reports it as "modified" rather than "FAILED". This is expected when CaptureOne or Lightroom edits a sidecar.
- **FAILED** -- a media file's hash does not match. This indicates corruption, accidental overwrite, or a file that was replaced. Investigate immediately.
- **MISSING** -- a file referenced in the catalog no longer exists on disk (catalog mode only). The file's location record exists but the file is gone from an online volume.
- **UNTRACKED** -- a file was found on disk but is not in the catalog (path mode only). The file's content hash does not match any known variant or recipe. Run `maki import` to bring it into the catalog, or ignore it if it is not a media file.
- **skipped** -- the file is on an offline volume, or the path could not be read.

If any files fail verification (FAILED status), MAKI exits with code 1. Scripts can check `$?` to detect problems:

```bash
maki verify --volume "Archive" || echo "Integrity check failed!"
```

### Incremental verification

On a large library, full verification can take hours. Use `--max-age` to skip files that were verified recently — this makes regular weekly or monthly runs practical:

```bash
# Skip files verified within the last 30 days
maki verify --max-age 30 --log

# Only verify files older than 7 days
maki verify --max-age 7 --volume "Work SSD" --log
```

You can set a default in `maki.toml` with `[verify] max_age_days`, so `maki verify` always skips recently-checked files unless you override with `--force`:

```bash
# Ignore max_age and re-verify everything
maki verify --force --log --time
```

### Monitoring flags

```bash
# Per-file progress to stderr
maki verify --log

# Machine-readable output
maki verify --json

# Show elapsed time
maki verify --time

# Combine them
maki verify --volume "Photos 2024" --log --time
```

### Checking verification age

Use the `stale:N` search filter to find assets that have not been verified recently:

```bash
# Assets not verified in the last 30 days
maki search "stale:30"

# Assets never verified
maki search "stale:0"
```

See [Browsing & Searching](05-browse-and-search.md) for more on search filters.


## Sync

`maki sync` reconciles the catalog with what is actually on disk. Run it after moving, renaming, or deleting files with external tools (Finder, `mv`, CaptureOne's "move to folder", etc.).

Unlike `verify` (which only checks hashes), `sync` scans the filesystem for structural changes: files that moved, new files that appeared, and files that disappeared.

### Report mode (safe default)

```bash
maki sync /Volumes/PhotosDrive/Photos/
```

Without `--apply`, sync scans the directory and reports what it finds, but changes nothing:

```
Sync complete: 1200 unchanged, 3 moved, 2 new, 1 modified, 4 missing
  Tip: run 'maki import' to import new files.
```

### Apply changes

```bash
maki sync /Volumes/PhotosDrive/Photos/ --apply
```

With `--apply`, sync updates the catalog and sidecar files:

- **Moved files**: The catalog path is updated to the new location (same content hash found at a different path, old path gone).
- **Modified recipes**: Recipe hash is updated, and if it is an XMP file, metadata is re-extracted.
- **Missing files**: Reported but not removed (use `--remove-stale`).
- **New files**: Reported but not imported. Run `maki import` separately.

### Removing stale records

```bash
maki sync /Volumes/PhotosDrive/Photos/ --apply --remove-stale
```

`--remove-stale` (which requires `--apply`) removes catalog location records for files that are confirmed missing. Use this when you intentionally deleted files and want the catalog to reflect that. If removing those locations leaves variants with no remaining locations (often the asset's *selected* preview variant), `sync` prints a follow-up tip pointing at `maki cleanup --apply` to remove the dangling variants and their orphaned previews/embeddings/face files.

### Scoping to a volume

```bash
maki sync /Volumes/PhotosDrive/ --volume "Photos 2024"
```

Explicitly sets the volume context when auto-detection picks the wrong one.

### Detection categories

| Status | Meaning | Action with `--apply` |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| unchanged | Hash matches at expected path | None |
| moved | Known hash found at new path, old path gone | Path updated in catalog |
| new | Unknown hash, not in catalog | Reported (run `maki import`) |
| modified | Same path, different hash (recipe files) | Hash updated, XMP re-extracted |
| missing | Catalog location exists but file is gone | Reported, or removed with `--remove-stale` |

### Monitoring flags

```bash
maki sync /Volumes/PhotosDrive/ --apply --log --time --json
```

`--log` shows per-file status, `--time` shows elapsed time, `--json` outputs structured results.


## Refresh

`maki refresh` re-reads metadata from recipe and media files without scanning the full filesystem. It is lighter than `sync` -- it only checks files the catalog already knows about, comparing their on-disk hash to the stored hash.

This is the right tool after editing in CaptureOne, Lightroom, or any other tool that modifies XMP sidecars.

### Refresh all recipes

```bash
maki refresh
```

Checks every recipe file location on all online volumes. For each recipe whose hash has changed:

- **XMP recipes** (`.xmp`): re-extracts keywords, rating, description, and color label, then updates the catalog and sidecar YAML.
- **Non-XMP recipes** (`.cos`, `.pp3`, `.dop`, etc.): hash updated, but no metadata extraction (these formats are opaque to maki).

### Refresh specific paths

```bash
maki refresh /Volumes/PhotosDrive/Capture/2026-02-01/
```

Only checks recipe files under the given path.

### Limit to a volume or asset

```bash
# All recipes on a specific volume
maki refresh --volume "Photos 2024"

# Only recipes for a specific asset
maki refresh --asset a1b2c3d4
```

### Re-extract embedded XMP from media files

```bash
maki refresh --media
```

The `--media` flag also scans JPEG and TIFF variant files, re-extracting embedded XMP metadata. This is useful in two scenarios:

1. **Retroactive extraction**: You imported files before the embedded XMP feature existed and want to pick up keywords/ratings/labels that were embedded all along.
2. **External edits**: A tool like CaptureOne or Lightroom modified the embedded XMP in a JPEG/TIFF file.

### Dry run

```bash
maki refresh --dry-run
```

Shows what would change without applying anything. Combine with `--log` for detailed output:

```bash
maki refresh --dry-run --log
```

Sample output:

```
  DSC_001.xmp — changed (12ms)
  DSC_002.xmp — unchanged (3ms)
  DSC_003.xmp — changed (11ms)
Dry run — Refresh complete: 2 refreshed, 1 unchanged, 0 missing, 0 skipped (offline)
```

### Monitoring flags

```bash
maki refresh --log --time --json
```


## Write Back *(Pro)*

`maki writeback` flushes pending metadata writes to XMP recipe files. The pending queue accumulates in two situations:

1. You edit metadata (rating, label, tags, description) while the asset's volume is offline. The auto-writeback path skips the file write and marks the recipe `pending_writeback` until the volume comes back.
2. `[writeback] enabled = false` (the default safety setting). Every metadata edit lands in the catalog and YAML sidecar and is flagged `pending_writeback`, but no `.xmp` file is touched. Then `maki writeback` is the explicit, one-off flush — your safety net stays in place between flushes.

> **Note:** `maki writeback` always works regardless of `[writeback] enabled`. The config flag governs only *automatic* writeback on every edit; this command is the manual flush. See the [Configuration Reference](../reference/08-configuration.md#writeback-section) for the auto-vs-manual split.

### Process pending write-backs

```bash
maki writeback
```

Without flags, only recipes with `pending_writeback=1` are processed. Each recipe's XMP file is updated with the current asset metadata (rating, label, tags, description), then re-hashed and the pending flag is cleared.

### Write back all XMP recipes

```bash
maki writeback --all
```

The `--all` flag writes current metadata to every XMP recipe, not just pending ones. Useful for an initial sync or to force-push all MAKI metadata to XMP files.

### Scope to a volume or asset

```bash
# Only write back to recipes on a specific volume
maki writeback --volume "Photos 2024"

# Only write back for a specific asset
maki writeback --asset a1b2c3d4
```

### Dry run

```bash
maki writeback --dry-run
```

Shows what would be written without modifying any files. Combine with `--log` for detailed output.

### How pending tracking works

When any metadata edit (CLI `maki edit`, `maki tag`, web UI stars/labels/tags/description) triggers XMP write-back, each recipe is checked:

- **Volume online, file exists**: XMP is written, `pending_writeback` stays 0.
- **Volume offline or file missing**: `pending_writeback` is set to 1. The flag persists until `maki writeback` clears it.

The flag records the *intent* to write back, not *what* changed. When writeback runs, it reads the current asset metadata and writes all four fields (rating, label, tags, description) to the XMP file.

### Recommended workflow: volume comes back online

```bash
# 1. Push MAKI edits to XMP (MAKI wins for fields edited while offline)
maki writeback --volume "Archive 2025"

# 2. Pull any CaptureOne/Lightroom edits from XMP
maki refresh --volume "Archive 2025"
```

Order matters: writeback first ensures MAKI edits land in the XMP files. Then refresh picks up anything the external tool changed independently.

### Monitoring flags

```bash
maki writeback --log --time --json
```

When recipes are skipped because their volume is offline, the summary names the offline volumes so you know which drives to reconnect before re-running:

```
Writeback: 0 written, 1 skipped (offline volumes: Archive 2025)
  → Reconnect "Archive 2025" and re-run `maki writeback`.
```

With `--json`, the same information is available as a `skipped_offline_volumes` array on the result object.

### Using `rsync` alongside `maki writeback`

A common backup pattern: keep the master files on one drive (say "Archive") and rsync them to a backup drive ("Archive-Backup") periodically. If both volumes are registered in MAKI, each asset has recipes on both volumes, and edits made while one drive is offline queue up as `pending_writeback` until that drive comes back online.

The workflow that takes the least effort:

```bash
# 1. Curate normally. Master volume is online, backup is offline.
#    MAKI edits flush inline to the master's XMP files; backup recipes
#    accumulate pending_writeback.

# 2. Bulk-sync the backup drive outside MAKI when ready:
rsync -av --delete /Volumes/Archive/ /Volumes/Archive-Backup/

# 3. Run a single writeback to reconcile:
maki writeback
```

In step 3, MAKI walks every pending recipe on the backup volume, reads each XMP, and finds that the rsync already wrote the values MAKI was about to write. No file writes happen. The pending flag clears, and the recipe's stored `content_hash` is reconciled to match the rsync'd file. Output looks like:

```
Writeback: 0 written, 90000 already in sync
```

A subsequent `maki verify --volume Archive-Backup` runs cleanly against the now-accurate hashes — no false-positive mismatches. The `already_in_sync` counter on the JSON result and the web toast surfaces the same information.

This works because MAKI's writeback is idempotent at the field level (the underlying `xmp_reader::update_*` primitives skip when nothing changed) and now also self-reconciles drifted content hashes on the no-write path. You don't need a separate "post-rsync refresh" step.


## Sync Metadata *(Pro)*

`maki sync-metadata` performs bidirectional XMP metadata sync in a single command — combining the inbound (refresh) and outbound (writeback) steps with conflict detection.

> **Note:** The outbound (writeback) phase honours `[writeback] enabled`. With auto-flush off (the default), `sync-metadata` performs inbound sync only — the catalog absorbs external XMP changes, but MAKI edits stay queued as `pending_writeback` until you run `maki writeback` (which always works regardless of the flag). With `enabled = true`, both directions run inline. See the [Configuration Reference](../reference/08-configuration.md#writeback-section).

### Basic usage

```bash
maki sync-metadata
```

This runs three phases:

1. **Inbound**: Detects externally modified XMP recipe files and re-reads their metadata (keywords, rating, description, color label).
2. **Outbound**: Finds recipes marked `pending_writeback` and writes current MAKI metadata back to the XMP file.
3. **Conflict detection**: When both the XMP file changed on disk AND the recipe has pending MAKI edits, the recipe is reported as a conflict and skipped.

### Scope to a volume or asset

```bash
maki sync-metadata --volume "Photos 2024"
maki sync-metadata --asset a1b2c3d4
```

### Include embedded XMP

```bash
maki sync-metadata --media
```

The `--media` flag adds a third phase that re-extracts embedded XMP from JPEG/TIFF variant files — useful after external tools modify embedded metadata.

### Dry run

```bash
maki sync-metadata --dry-run --log
```

Shows what would change without modifying any files.

### When to use sync-metadata vs. writeback + refresh

- **`sync-metadata`**: The recommended single command for most workflows. Handles both directions and detects conflicts.
- **`writeback` + `refresh`**: Use separately when you want explicit control over direction (e.g., force MAKI edits to win with `writeback --all`, then pull external changes with `refresh`).


## Working with External Tools

MAKI is designed to coexist with tools like CaptureOne, Lightroom, RawTherapee, and DxO. Metadata flows between MAKI and these tools through XMP sidecar files. This section describes common round-trip scenarios.

### Prerequisite: enable XMP sidecar writing in your photo editor

Most photo editors do **not** write XMP sidecar files by default. You need to enable this in each tool's settings, otherwise MAKI has no metadata to read.

| Tool | Setting | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| **CaptureOne** | Enable "Auto-write XMP sidecar" | Preferences → General → Metadata, or per-session in the tool tab |
| **Lightroom Classic** | Enable "Automatically write changes into XMP" | Catalog Settings → Metadata |
| **RawTherapee** | XMP sidecars are always written | No setting needed |
| **DxO PhotoLab** | Enable "Write to XMP sidecar" | Preferences → General |
| **darktable** | Enable "Write sidecar file for each image" | Settings → Storage |

Without this setting, your ratings, keywords, and labels stay locked inside the tool's proprietary database and are invisible to MAKI.

### "I rated and tagged in CaptureOne/Lightroom — how do I get those changes into MAKI?"

External tools write ratings, keywords, descriptions, and color labels to `.xmp` sidecar files. Use `refresh` to read those changes:

```bash
maki refresh --volume "Work SSD" --log
```

This detects XMP files that changed since the last import or refresh, and updates the catalog with the new metadata. Tags from XMP are merged (union) with existing MAKI tags.

If the external tool also modified embedded XMP in JPEG or TIFF files (e.g., Lightroom export with metadata), add `--media`:

```bash
maki refresh --media --volume "Work SSD" --log
```

### "I rated and tagged in MAKI — how do I get those changes into CaptureOne/Lightroom?"

Use `writeback` to push MAKI metadata to XMP files on disk. The external tool picks up the changes when it re-reads the sidecar:

```bash
maki writeback --volume "Work SSD" --log
```

This writes rating, color label, tags, and description to every XMP recipe flagged `pending_writeback`. Works whether or not `[writeback] enabled = true` — that config controls only *automatic* writeback on every edit; the `writeback` command is the explicit manual flush.

For an initial sync (pushing all MAKI metadata to XMP, not just pending changes):

```bash
maki writeback --all --volume "Work SSD" --log
```

### "I worked in both tools — how do I sync everything?"

Use `sync-metadata` for bidirectional sync with conflict detection:

```bash
maki sync-metadata --volume "Work SSD" --log
```

This reads external XMP changes, writes pending MAKI edits, and reports conflicts (files where both MAKI and the external tool made changes). Conflicts are skipped — you can resolve them by choosing which direction should win:

```bash
# Force MAKI edits to win, then pull any remaining external changes
maki writeback --all --volume "Work SSD"
maki refresh --volume "Work SSD"
```

### "I imported old files that had XMP metadata I didn't capture"

If files were imported before MAKI supported embedded XMP extraction (or before sidecar XMP files existed), you can retroactively pick up that metadata:

```bash
# Re-extract embedded XMP from JPEG/TIFF files
maki refresh --media --log

# Re-read all XMP sidecar files
maki refresh --log
```

### Summary: which command when?

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| External tool edited XMP sidecars | `maki refresh` |
| External tool edited embedded XMP in JPEG/TIFF | `maki refresh --media` |
| Push MAKI edits to XMP for external tools | `maki writeback` |
| Bidirectional sync with conflict detection | `maki sync-metadata` |
| Force MAKI metadata to all XMP files | `maki writeback --all` |
| Pick up metadata from old imports | `maki refresh --media` |


## Cleanup

`maki cleanup` scans all file locations and recipes across online volumes, checking whether the referenced files still exist on disk. It removes stale records, locationless variants, and orphaned derived files in eight passes.

### Report mode (safe default)

```bash
maki cleanup
```

Without `--apply`, cleanup reports what it finds:

```
Cleanup complete: 1500 checked, 12 stale, 3 orphaned assets, 5 orphaned previews, 2 orphaned embeddings
  Run with --apply to remove stale records and orphaned files.
```

### Apply cleanup

```bash
maki cleanup --apply
```

The eight passes:

1. **Stale location and recipe records**: Removes catalog entries for files that no longer exist on disk (variant file locations and recipe file locations). Updates sidecar YAML files accordingly.
2. **Locationless variants**: Removes variants with zero remaining file locations from assets that still have other located variants. Prevents ghost variants from accumulating after file moves or reimports.
3. **Orphaned assets**: Deletes assets where all variants have zero file locations remaining. Their recipes, variants, faces, embeddings, previews, smart previews, face crops, embedding binaries, catalog rows, and sidecar YAML files are removed.
4. **Orphaned previews**: Removes preview JPEG files whose content hash no longer matches any variant in the catalog.
5. **Orphaned smart previews**: Same for the `smart-previews/` directory.
6. **Orphaned embeddings**: Removes SigLIP embedding binaries whose asset ID no longer exists.
7. **Orphaned face crops**: Removes face crop thumbnails whose face ID no longer exists.
8. **Orphaned ArcFace embeddings**: Removes face embedding binaries whose face ID no longer exists.

### Limit to a specific volume

```bash
maki cleanup --volume "Photos 2024" --apply
```

Only scans file locations on the specified volume. Useful after removing a drive's contents intentionally.

### Limit to a specific path

```bash
maki cleanup --path "Capture/2026-02" --apply
maki cleanup --volume "Photos" --path "Archive/Old" --apply --log
```

Scopes stale-location scanning to files under a path prefix. Absolute paths are auto-detected to extract the volume and relative prefix.

### List stale entries

```bash
maki cleanup --list
```

Prints stale entries to stderr (similar to `--log`, but only shows stale entries rather than every file checked).

### Offline volumes

Offline volumes are skipped automatically with a note. MAKI never removes records for files on an offline volume -- it cannot know whether the file is truly gone or just disconnected.

### Monitoring flags

```bash
maki cleanup --apply --log --time --json
```


## Relocating Assets

`maki relocate` copies (or moves) all of an asset's files -- variants and recipes -- to another volume. Use this to migrate assets between drives, create backups on a second volume, or consolidate scattered files.

### Copy to another volume

```bash
maki relocate a1b2c3d4 "Archive Drive"
```

This copies all files for the asset to the target volume, preserving their relative paths. The asset now has files on both volumes. After the copy, each file is verified via SHA-256 to ensure integrity.

### Move (copy + delete source)

```bash
maki relocate a1b2c3d4 "Archive Drive" --remove-source
```

With `--remove-source`, the source files are deleted after successful copy and verification. The asset's locations are updated to point to the new volume only.

### Dry run

```bash
maki relocate a1b2c3d4 "Archive Drive" --dry-run
```

Shows what would be copied or moved without making any changes:

```
Dry run — no changes made:
  Copy Capture/2026-02-01/DSC_001.nef → Archive Drive:Capture/2026-02-01/DSC_001.nef
  Copy Capture/2026-02-01/DSC_001.xmp → Archive Drive:Capture/2026-02-01/DSC_001.xmp
```

### Batch relocation with `--query`

The single-asset examples above are useful for individual files, but the real power of `relocate` is moving entire shoots, years, or collections to another drive in one pass:

```bash
# Preview: migrate all 2025 images from the work SSD to archive
maki relocate --query "date:2025 volume:Work SSD" --target "Archive 2025" --dry-run

# Execute the copy
maki relocate --query "date:2025 volume:Work SSD" --target "Archive 2025" --log

# After verifying the archive, free the working drive
maki relocate --query "date:2025 volume:Work SSD" --target "Archive 2025" --remove-source --log
```

The `--query` flag accepts the same search syntax as `maki search`, so you can combine any filters:

```bash
# Move a specific shoot to archive
maki relocate --query "tag:johnson-wedding" --target "Archive 2026" --log

# Copy all single-copy images to a backup drive
maki backup-status --at-risk -q | maki relocate --target "Backup A" --log

# Move all videos to a dedicated video drive
maki relocate --query "type:video volume:Work SSD" --target "Video Archive" --remove-source --log
```

**Tip:** Always run without `--remove-source` first (copy), verify the result, then run again with `--remove-source` (move) in a second pass. This gives you a safety window before deleting source files.

### Creating XMP sidecars on relocate

When copying files to a working drive where you'll open them in CaptureOne or Lightroom, use `--create-sidecars` to generate `.xmp` files with your MAKI metadata (ratings, tags, labels, descriptions):

```bash
maki relocate --query "rating:3+" --target "Work SSD" --create-sidecars --log
```

This creates an XMP sidecar alongside each variant that doesn't already have one on the target volume. The external tool picks up your ratings and tags immediately on import.


## Updating File Locations

`maki update-location` fixes the catalog after you manually moved a single file on disk. Unlike `sync` (which scans a directory), this command targets one specific file.

### Basic usage

```bash
maki update-location a1b2c3d4 \
    --from Capture/2026-02-01/DSC_001.nef \
    --to /Volumes/PhotosDrive/Archive/2026/DSC_001.nef
```

- `--to` must be an absolute path to the file's current location on disk.
- `--from` can be absolute or volume-relative (the path as it appears in the catalog).

### How it works

1. maki resolves the asset by ID (or unique prefix).
2. The volume is auto-detected from `--to` by matching against registered volume mount points. You can override with `--volume`.
3. maki hashes the file at `--to` and compares it to the stored content hash. If they do not match, the command fails (safety check -- you may have pointed to the wrong file).
4. The catalog and sidecar YAML are updated with the new path.

### Specifying the volume explicitly

```bash
maki update-location a1b2c3d4 \
    --from Capture/old/DSC_001.nef \
    --to /Volumes/NewDrive/Capture/new/DSC_001.nef \
    --volume "New Drive"
```

This also handles recipe file locations, not just variant files.


## Rebuilding the Catalog

`maki rebuild-catalog` wipes the SQLite database and reconstructs it from the YAML sidecar files, which are the source of truth.

```bash
maki rebuild-catalog
```

Sample output:

```
Rebuild complete: 1847 assets, 2914 variants, 312 recipes, 3 collections, 45 stacks
```

### When to use it

- The SQLite database is corrupted or deleted.
- You manually edited sidecar YAML files and want the catalog to reflect those changes.
- Something seems out of sync and you want a clean slate.

### What is preserved

- **Sidecar YAML files**: Untouched (they are the source, not the target).
- **Collections**: Restored from `collections.yaml` at the catalog root.
- **Stacks**: Restored from `stacks.yaml` at the catalog root (member order and pick assignments are preserved).
- **Faces and people** *(Pro)*: Restored from `faces.yaml` and `people.yaml`. ArcFace face embeddings restored from binary files in `embeddings/arcface/`.
- **Image embeddings** *(Pro)*: SigLIP embeddings restored from binary files in `embeddings/<model>/`.
- **Preview files**: Untouched (they are content-addressed by hash).
- **Volumes**: Re-registered from `volumes.yaml`.

### What is regenerated

- All SQLite tables (assets, variants, recipes, file locations, tags, stacks).
- Denormalized columns (`best_variant_hash`, `primary_variant_format`, `variant_count`).
- Collection membership records (from `collections.yaml`).
- Stack membership records (from `stacks.yaml`).

This is a safe operation -- only the derived cache (SQLite) is rebuilt. No files on disk are modified or deleted.


## Fix Dates

`maki fix-dates` corrects asset dates that were set incorrectly during import. This commonly happens when files lack EXIF metadata (e.g., old JPEGs without DateTimeOriginal) — the import timestamp was used instead of the capture date.

### How it works

For each asset, `fix-dates` collects candidate dates from all variants:

1. **EXIF DateTimeOriginal** from stored `source_metadata` (for assets imported since v1.3.1)
2. **Re-extracted EXIF** from the file on disk (for older assets without stored date)
3. **File modification time** on disk

The oldest date across all variants becomes the corrected `created_at`.

### Report mode (safe default)

```bash
maki fix-dates
```

Shows what would be changed:

```
Warning: volume 'Archive' is offline — cannot read files for date extraction
Fix-dates: 5000 checked, 3200 fixed, 800 already correct, 1000 skipped (volume offline)
  Run with --apply to make changes.
  Mount offline volumes and re-run to fix remaining assets.
```

### Apply fixes

```bash
maki fix-dates --apply --log
```

Updates both the SQLite catalog and sidecar YAML files. Also backfills EXIF dates into variant metadata so future runs work without needing the volume online.

### Offline volumes

`fix-dates` needs file access for EXIF re-extraction and file modification times. Assets on offline volumes are skipped with a clear message. Mount the volume and re-run to fix them.

### Scope to a volume or asset

```bash
# Fix dates for assets on a specific volume
maki fix-dates --volume "Photos 2024" --apply --log

# Fix a single asset
maki fix-dates --asset a1b2c3d4 --apply
```


## Fix Roles

`maki fix-roles` corrects variant roles in assets that have both RAW and non-RAW variants. In these groups, the RAW variant should be the Original and non-RAW variants should be Exports. If roles are incorrect (e.g., both marked as Original), this command fixes them.

### Report mode (safe default)

```bash
maki fix-roles
```

Shows what would be changed:

```
Dry run — Fix-roles: 150 checked, 3 fixed (5 variant(s)), 147 already correct
  Run with --apply to make changes.
```

### Apply fixes

```bash
maki fix-roles --apply
```

Updates both the SQLite catalog and sidecar YAML files.

### Scope to a volume or asset

```bash
# Only check assets on a specific volume
maki fix-roles --volume "Photos 2024" --apply

# Fix a single asset
maki fix-roles --asset a1b2c3d4 --apply
```


## Fix Recipes

`maki fix-recipes` repairs a specific situation: recipe files (`.xmp`, `.cos`, `.pp3`, etc.) that were imported as standalone assets instead of being attached to their media files. This happens when recipe and media files are imported in separate passes, or when recipe files live in a different directory from their media.

The result is phantom assets in your catalog — assets whose only variant is a recipe file, when they should have been attached to the corresponding media asset.

```bash
# Preview what would be fixed
maki fix-recipes

# Apply fixes
maki fix-recipes --apply --log

# Scope to a specific volume or asset
maki fix-recipes --volume "Work SSD" --apply
maki fix-recipes --asset a1b2c3d4 --apply
```

The command matches recipe files to media files by filename stem (e.g., `DSC_001.xmp` attaches to the asset containing `DSC_001.nef`). When a match is found, the recipe is moved from its standalone asset to the correct media asset, and the now-empty standalone asset is removed.

For the full command reference, see [fix-recipes](../reference/05-maintain-commands.md#maki-fix-recipes).


## Preview Management

During import, MAKI generates preview thumbnails (800px by default) for every media file. Over time, previews can become stale or insufficient — after processing in external tools, after changing preview settings, or when you need offline zoom capabilities. The `maki generate-previews` command lets you regenerate and upgrade previews.

### Upgrading previews after processing

When you import RAW files, the auto-generated preview is rendered from the RAW data. If you later export a processed TIFF or JPEG from CaptureOne or Lightroom and import it as an additional variant, the preview still shows the original RAW rendering. Use `--upgrade` to regenerate previews from the better variant:

```bash
# Regenerate previews where a processed/export variant exists
maki generate-previews --upgrade --log
```

This checks each asset for export or processed variants and regenerates the preview from the highest-quality one. Assets with only an original variant are skipped.

### Smart previews for offline browsing

Smart previews are high-resolution versions (2560px) that enable zoom and pan in the web UI — even when the original volume is offline. Generate them for assets you want to review without connecting the source drive:

```bash
# Generate smart previews for a volume before disconnecting it
maki generate-previews --volume "Work SSD" --smart --log

# Generate smart previews for your best images
maki search -q "rating:4+" | maki generate-previews --smart --log
```

Smart previews are also generated during import with `maki import --smart` or when `[import] smart_previews = true` is set in `maki.toml`.

### Force regeneration

After changing preview settings in `maki.toml` (e.g., increasing `max_edge`, switching `format` from JPEG to WebP, or adjusting `quality`), existing previews still use the old settings. Use `--force` to regenerate all previews:

```bash
maki generate-previews --force --log --time
```

### Scoping

Limit regeneration to a specific volume, asset, or path:

```bash
# Only regenerate previews for one volume
maki generate-previews --volume "Archive 2025" --log

# Only regenerate for a specific asset
maki generate-previews --asset a1b2c3d4

# Only process image files (skip video, audio)
maki generate-previews --skip video --skip audio --log
```

For the full command reference, see [generate-previews](../reference/05-maintain-commands.md#maki-generate-previews).


## Storage Hygiene

Over time, a multi-volume library accumulates duplicate files and uneven backup coverage. MAKI provides three commands that work together to answer the key storage questions: *Do I have unwanted copies wasting space?* and *Are my important files safely backed up?*

### Finding and understanding duplicates

The first step is understanding what duplicates you have and *why* they exist. Same-volume and cross-volume duplicates answer fundamentally different questions:

| Mode | Question it answers | Typical action |
|------|-------|--------|
| `--same-volume` | Do I have accidental copies on the same drive? | Clean up with `maki dedup` |
| `--cross-volume` | Are my files backed up across drives? | Verify coverage is sufficient |

```bash
# Accidental duplicates — candidates for cleanup
maki duplicates --same-volume

# Backup verification — these copies are wanted
maki duplicates --cross-volume
```

See [Finding Duplicates](05-browse-and-search.md#finding-duplicates) for detailed examples and output formats.

### Removing unwanted duplicates

`maki dedup` removes same-volume duplicates automatically. It only targets files that appear more than once on the **same** drive — cross-volume copies (your backups) are never touched.

```bash
# Preview what would be removed
maki dedup

# Apply, preferring files under "Selects/" when choosing which copy to keep
maki dedup --prefer "Selects" --apply --log
```

The resolution heuristic decides which copy to keep: prefer paths matching `--prefer`, then most recently verified, then shortest path. Use `--min-copies` to ensure a minimum number of total copies survive across all volumes:

```bash
# Never reduce a file to fewer than 2 copies total
maki dedup --min-copies 2 --apply
```

See the [Dedup Command Reference](../reference/05-maintain-commands.md#maki-dedup) for all options.

### Checking backup coverage

`maki backup-status` reports which assets lack copies on archive or backup volumes. This works best when your volumes have a [purpose](02-setup.md#volume-purposes) assigned:

```bash
maki backup-status
```

#### Finding at-risk assets

Use `--at-risk` to get a concrete list of under-backed-up assets:

```bash
# Assets with fewer than 2 copies (the default threshold)
maki backup-status --at-risk

# Stricter policy: require 3 copies
maki backup-status --min-copies 3 --at-risk

# Scope to rated images only
maki backup-status --at-risk -q "rating:1+"
```

#### Checking coverage for a specific volume

Use `--volume` to answer "which of my files aren't on this drive yet?":

```bash
# Which assets are missing from the backup drive?
maki backup-status --volume "Backup A" --at-risk

# Output as IDs for scripting
maki backup-status --volume "Backup A" --at-risk -q
```

#### Fixing coverage gaps

Pipe at-risk asset IDs directly into `relocate` to copy them to a backup drive:

```bash
maki backup-status --at-risk -q | maki relocate --target "Backup A" --log
```

For a quick check from search, the `copies:` filter finds under-backed-up assets directly:

```bash
# Single-copy assets — at risk if the drive fails
maki search "copies:1"

# Assets with 3+ copies — potential over-redundancy
maki search "copies:3+"
```

The [web UI backup page](06-web-ui.md#backup-status-page) provides a visual dashboard with volume distribution charts and gap analysis.


## Aligning Flat Tags to the AI Vocabulary *(Pro)*

The AI vocabulary file (`[ai] labels = "my-labels.yaml"`) maps each flat label the SigLIP classifier sees to its canonical hierarchical home in your catalog. For new assets, MAKI applies the hierarchical form directly. But two situations still leave flat tags behind:

- **Vocabulary growth.** When you add a new mapping (`dog: subject|animal|domestic`), assets previously tagged with the bare `dog` keep the flat form. The mapping only steers *future* AI suggestions.
- **Inbound imports.** Sidecar XMP from Lightroom / CaptureOne typically arrives as flat keywords. MAKI imports them as-is, so `sunset`, `concert`, `landscape` land flat in the catalog.

The `scripts/apply-vocabulary.py` helper reads the vocabulary YAML and emits the `maki tag rename` / `maki tag split` commands needed to move every flat label into its hierarchical home. Run it whenever the vocabulary changes or after a batch of flat-tagged imports.

### How it works

For each entry in the vocabulary:

- `label: tag` — emits `maki tag rename =label tag` (whole-path match so it touches only the flat form, not `something|label`).
- `label: [tag1, tag2]` — emits `maki tag split =label tag1 tag2` (one-to-many fan-out).
- `label: null` or identity (`label: label`) — skipped, no rename needed.

The script doesn't query the catalog — it emits every command for every mapping. Tags that don't exist in your catalog are no-ops at execution time (MAKI reports "no assets found" and moves on), so the output is safe to run unconditionally. Ancestor paths (`subject`, `subject|nature`, …) are auto-expanded by `maki tag rename` itself, so you don't need to spell them out.

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Review what would change — dry-run by default
python3 scripts/apply-vocabulary.py

# 2. Save for review, then execute
python3 scripts/apply-vocabulary.py --apply > apply-vocab.sh
less apply-vocab.sh
sh apply-vocab.sh
```

The script picks up your active `[ai] labels` automatically via `maki ai export-vocabulary`. Three other ways to scope it:

```bash
# Built-in default vocabulary
python3 scripts/apply-vocabulary.py --default

# Explicit file (e.g. test a candidate before adopting it)
python3 scripts/apply-vocabulary.py path/to/my-labels.yaml

# Pipe straight to sh — fine for the recurring case once you trust your vocab
python3 scripts/apply-vocabulary.py --apply | sh
```

After running the script, the dc:subject XMP keyword list still reflects every flat component (`subject`, `nature`, `landscape`, …) because `maki tag rename` writes back through the same hierarchical/flat pair MAKI uses everywhere — Lightroom and CaptureOne see the full keyword set.

### When to run

Run after any of these:

- Editing `my-labels.yaml` (adding mappings, splitting flat labels, promoting branches).
- A batch import that brought in flat keywords from external XMP sidecars.
- Periodically — quarterly, or alongside `maki verify` — as a hygiene pass that catches drift.


## Recommended Maintenance Workflow

A practical schedule for keeping your catalog healthy:

### 1. Periodic integrity checks

Run `maki verify` on a regular schedule -- weekly for active volumes, monthly for archives:

```bash
# Verify the active working drive
maki verify --volume "Work SSD"

# Find assets that haven't been verified in 90 days
maki search "stale:90"
```

### 2. After editing in external tools

When you finish a session in CaptureOne, Lightroom, or another tool that edits XMP sidecars, run `maki refresh` to pick up the changes:

```bash
maki refresh --volume "Work SSD" --log
```

If the external tool also modified embedded metadata in JPEG/TIFF exports:

```bash
maki refresh --media --volume "Work SSD"
```

### 3. After moving or reorganizing files

If you moved files on disk (renamed directories, reorganized folder structure), run `maki sync` to reconcile:

```bash
# First, see what changed
maki sync /Volumes/PhotosDrive/Photos/

# Then apply
maki sync /Volumes/PhotosDrive/Photos/ --apply
```

If new files appeared (e.g., CaptureOne exported new TIFFs), import them:

```bash
maki import /Volumes/PhotosDrive/Photos/Exports/
```

### 4. Periodic cleanup and storage hygiene

Run `maki cleanup` periodically to remove stale records for files that no longer exist:

```bash
# See what would be cleaned up
maki cleanup --list

# Apply
maki cleanup --apply
```

After cleanup, check for accidental duplicates and verify backup coverage:

```bash
# Any unwanted same-volume duplicates?
maki duplicates --same-volume

# Are backups in good shape?
maki backup-status
```

See [Storage Hygiene](#storage-hygiene) above for the full workflow.

### 5. After editing the AI vocabulary or importing flat-tagged sidecars *(Pro)*

When `my-labels.yaml` grows or external XMP sidecars bring in flat keywords, align the catalog to the vocabulary:

```bash
# Preview
python3 scripts/apply-vocabulary.py

# Execute
python3 scripts/apply-vocabulary.py --apply | sh
```

See [Aligning Flat Tags to the AI Vocabulary](#aligning-flat-tags-to-the-ai-vocabulary-pro) above for the full workflow.

### 6. Nuclear option: rebuild

If the catalog seems fundamentally out of sync -- searches return wrong results, show displays stale data -- rebuild from the sidecar files:

```bash
maki rebuild-catalog
```

This is safe and fast. The sidecar YAML files are the source of truth; the SQLite database is just a derived cache.

### Putting it all together

A typical maintenance session after reconnecting an archive drive:

```bash
# 1. Check file integrity
maki verify --volume "Archive 2025" --time

# 2. Push any MAKI edits made while the drive was offline
maki writeback --volume "Archive 2025"

# 3. Pick up any recipe changes made while the drive was connected elsewhere
maki refresh --volume "Archive 2025"

# 4. Reconcile any moved/renamed files
maki sync /Volumes/Archive2025/ --apply

# 5. Clean up any stale records
maki cleanup --volume "Archive 2025" --apply

# 6. Check for accidental duplicates on this volume
maki duplicates --same-volume --volume "Archive 2025"

# 7. Align flat tags from any imported sidecars to your hierarchy (Pro)
python3 scripts/apply-vocabulary.py --apply | sh

# 8. Verify backup coverage across all volumes
maki backup-status

# 9. Confirm everything looks good
maki stats --volumes
```

## Backing Up Your Catalog with Git

MAKI's source of truth is the YAML sidecar files in the `metadata/` directory. The SQLite database, previews, and embeddings are all derived and can be regenerated. This makes the catalog an ideal candidate for git version control — you get full history, easy rollback, and protection against accidental bulk operations.

### Setup

`maki init` creates a `.gitignore` that excludes derived files. To start tracking your catalog:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/catalog   # the directory containing maki.toml
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial catalog snapshot"
```

The `.gitignore` excludes:

- `catalog.db` (rebuilt via `maki rebuild-catalog`)
- `previews/` and `smart-previews/` (regenerated via `maki generate-previews`)
- `embeddings/` and `faces/` (regenerated via `maki embed`, `maki faces detect`)

What gets tracked: `metadata/**/*.yaml` (all asset metadata), `volumes.yaml`, `collections.yaml`, `stacks.yaml`, `searches.toml`, and `maki.toml`.

### Snapshotting before bulk operations

Before running bulk operations like `tag rename`, `fix-roles`, `dedup`, or `cleanup`, create a snapshot:

```bash
# Using the provided script
bash scripts/backup-catalog.sh "Before tag cleanup"

# Or manually
cd /path/to/your/catalog
git add -A && git commit -m "Before tag cleanup"
```

### Recovering from mistakes

If a bulk operation goes wrong:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/catalog

# See what changed
git log --oneline
git diff HEAD~1 -- metadata/

# Restore all metadata to a previous state
git checkout HEAD~1 -- metadata/
maki rebuild-catalog

# Or restore just specific assets
git checkout HEAD~1 -- metadata/a1/a1b2c3d4-*.yaml
maki rebuild-catalog
```

The `maki rebuild-catalog` step regenerates the SQLite database from the restored YAML files.

### What this protects against

- Accidental bulk tag renames or deletions
- Metadata lost during `cleanup` or `dedup`
- Any operation that modifies YAML sidecars

What it does NOT protect against: file deletions on disk (`maki delete --remove-files`), or XMP writeback changes (those modify files on your volumes, not in the catalog).

## Recovering from a Drive Failure

When a storage device fails, MAKI's multi-volume architecture and content-addressable design help you assess the damage and recover. Here is a step-by-step playbook.

### 1. Assess the damage

Check which volume is affected and how many assets were on it:

```bash
# Which volumes are online/offline?
maki volume list

# How many assets had files on the failed drive?
maki search "volume:FailedDrive" --format ids | wc -l
```

### 2. Check what's backed up

Assets with copies on other volumes are safe. The key question is: which assets were *only* on the failed drive?

```bash
# Assets that exist ONLY on the failed drive (single-copy, at risk)
maki search "volume:FailedDrive copies:1"

# Assets that have copies elsewhere (safe)
maki search "volume:FailedDrive copies:2+"
```

For a broader view, use `backup-status`:

```bash
maki backup-status --at-risk
```

### 3. Recover what you can

If you have partial data recovery from the failed drive, import the recovered files. MAKI matches by content hash, so recovered files are automatically linked to existing assets:

```bash
maki import /path/to/recovered-files/ --log
```

### 4. Clean up stale records

Once you've recovered everything possible, remove the references to the dead drive:

```bash
# Preview what would be cleaned up
maki cleanup --volume "FailedDrive"

# Apply cleanup
maki cleanup --volume "FailedDrive" --apply --log
```

This removes file location records pointing to the failed volume. Assets that still have locations on other volumes are preserved. Assets with no remaining locations become orphaned and are removed in the cleanup pass.

### 5. Rebuild backup coverage

After cleanup, check what gaps remain and fill them:

```bash
# Which assets now have only one copy?
maki backup-status --at-risk --min-copies 2

# Copy at-risk assets to a new backup drive
maki backup-status --at-risk -q | maki relocate --target "New Backup" --log
```

### 6. If the catalog itself is lost

If the drive that held your MAKI catalog (the `.maki/` directory) fails, but your media volumes are intact, you can rebuild from scratch. The YAML sidecar files next to your media files are the source of truth — the SQLite database is just a derived cache:

```bash
# In a new directory
maki init

# Re-register your surviving volumes
maki volume add "Photos" /Volumes/PhotosDrive
maki volume add "Backup" /Volumes/BackupDrive

# Rebuild the catalog from sidecar files
maki rebuild-catalog
```

This restores all assets, variants, recipes, metadata, tags, ratings, and descriptions — everything that was stored in the YAML sidecars. Collections, stacks, and saved searches are also restored (they're stored as YAML in the catalog directory). Only preview thumbnails and AI embeddings need to be regenerated.
