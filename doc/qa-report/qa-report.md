# MAKI QA Report — 2026-05-03

State at v4.4.14 (post-release). Baseline: 63 321 Rust LOC across ~80 files, 12 051 template LOC. Tests at this baseline: 779 lib + 249 CLI + 14 doc on standard, 886 + 273 + 14 on pro.

This report focuses on **what's left** after the substantial extraction work landed in v4.4.5 (web/routes split 6599 → 348 LOC across 13 submodules, `cli_output.rs`, `Volume::online_map`, `resolve_collection_ids`) and v4.4.13–14 (`run_faces_command` lifted, `build_search_where` decomposed, `AssetService::embed_assets` extracted, `JobRegistry` lifted).

Previous QA reports are archived under `doc/qa-report/archive/`.

## Status

- **Batch 1 (small DRY wins)**: ✅ landed in commit `6889825` (2026-05-03). Tests still 779/249/886/273. See per-item status below.
- **Batch 2 (structural splits)**: 🟡 partial — afternoon scope (M1 + H1 + M2) done across `85984f8`, `7ce8d11`, `9d24d8f` (2026-05-03). Tests still 779/249/886/273. **H3, H2, M3+M4 remain** — sized for separate focused sessions per the original plan.
- **Batch 3 (documentation polish)**: pending.

## Findings — by severity

### HIGH

| # | Finding | Citation | Notes |
|---|---------|----------|-------|
| H1 | 🟡 **PARTIAL** (`7ce8d11`, 2026-05-03) — extracted the five longest arms (Import, Tag, AutoTag, RebuildCatalog, Volume); `run_command` shrank 5921 → 4062 LOC. Remaining big arms (GeneratePreviews 281, Collection 206, Describe 197, Cleanup 193, SavedSearch 165) follow the same mechanical pattern; left for opportunistic cleanup as touched. | `src/main.rs` | — |
| H2 | `catalog.rs` 9 200 LOC god-module | `src/catalog.rs` | Mixes asset CRUD, variant CRUD, location CRUD, recipe storage, schema migrations, denormalised-column maintenance, duplicates queries, rebuild logic. Natural cleavage planes: `catalog/{assets,variants,recipes,migrations,denorm}.rs` re-exporting through one `Catalog` impl. |
| H3 | `asset_service.rs` 8 886 LOC mixing service workflows | `src/asset_service.rs` | Section comment headers (`// ═══ X ═══`) already mark cleavage planes. Splits: `asset_service/{import,verify,sync,dedup,refresh,export,ai}.rs`. Each section is ~700–1 500 LOC. |
| H4 | ✅ **DONE** (`6889825`) — `resolve_asset_id` boilerplate lifted into `web::routes::resolve_asset_id_or_err`; 7 sites migrated, message format unified. | `web/routes/{browse,ai,media,stacks,assets,collections}.rs` | — |
| H5 | ⚠️ **HELPER LANDED, MIGRATION OPPORTUNISTIC** (`6889825`) — `web::routes::spawn_catalog_blocking` returns `Result<T, Response>` so handlers short-circuit on `?`. 3 demo sites migrated; remaining ~100 sites left for opportunistic cleanup. Recount: 106 actual `spawn_blocking` sites across 13 files (initial 40+ estimate was low). | `web/routes/*.rs` | — |
| H6 | `main.rs` has **zero inline tests** for 8 804 LOC of CLI dispatch | `src/main.rs` | Compare: catalog.rs (121 test blocks), asset_service.rs (67), query.rs (211). The CLI integration suite (`tests/cli.rs`, 249/273 tests) covers external behaviour but not internal helpers within main. Some critical paths (CLI argument parsing edge cases, error message formatting) have no coverage. |

### MEDIUM

| # | Finding | Citation | Notes |
|---|---------|----------|-------|
| M1 | ✅ **DONE** (`85984f8`, 2026-05-03) — split into `web/routes/ai/{mod,tags,embed,similarity,faces,stroll}.rs`. Shared `resolve_model_dir` / `resolve_labels` helpers stay in `mod.rs`. | `src/web/routes/ai/` | — |
| M2 | ✅ **DONE** (`9d24d8f`, 2026-05-03) — extracted the parsing layer into `query/parse.rs` (date parser, ParsedSearch + impls, query tokenizer, parse_search_query 245-LOC dispatcher, NumericFilter, normalize_path_for_search). Public API unchanged via `pub use parse::*;`. query.rs went 6820 → 6028 LOC. The further search-impl/write-impl split the report originally suggested can follow if the file grows again. | `src/query/parse.rs` | — |
| M3 | `build_search_where` still 356 LOC after v4.4.5 decomposition | `src/catalog.rs:3017-3373` | Further per-filter-type extraction: text, tags, dates, numeric, custom. Each becomes a private helper returning `(clause, params, needs_join_*)`. |
| M4 | `parse_search_query` is a 241-line tokenizer with 40+ `strip_prefix` branches | `src/query.rs:404-645` | Replace the if-chain with table-driven dispatch (HashMap or const slice of `(prefix, parser)` tuples). Easier to add filter types and easier to test individual parsers. |
| M5 | ❌ **WITHDRAWN** (`6889825`) — re-inspection showed the flagged site builds a `Vec<&Volume>` for sequential iteration, not a `HashMap`; `online_map()` returns the wrong shape. The original code is correct as-is. | `src/asset_service.rs:4753` | — |
| M6 | ✅ **DONE** (`6889825`) — `classify_impl` renamed to `classify_inner` (4 refs in `ai.rs`). Codebase now uniformly uses `_inner` for private helpers. | `src/ai.rs` | — |
| M7 | 20 of 33 `src/` files lack `//!` module docs | incl. `main.rs`, `catalog.rs`, `asset_service.rs`, `query.rs`, `xmp_reader.rs`, `face_store.rs`, `preview.rs`, `config.rs` | One-or-two-sentence summary per file. Unblocks `cargo doc` legibility and makes onboarding less archaeology. |
| M8 | 81 undocumented public items in the top-three files | `catalog.rs` 32, `asset_service.rs` 29, `query.rs` 20 | Prioritise `pub fn` and `pub struct` on the public-facing API surface (`Catalog`, `QueryEngine`, `AssetService` entrypoints). |
| M9 | Large templates lack purpose comments | `templates/{browse,asset,compare,stroll,people,filter_bar_js,lightbox_js}.html` | Newer partials (`import_dialog.html`, `job_toast.html`) start with a 4–8 line HTML comment explaining what the partial is, where it's mounted, and how external code interacts with it. The old large templates have nothing. |

### LOW

| # | Finding | Citation | Notes |
|---|---------|----------|-------|
| L1 | Inconsistent error-response shape in web routes | various `web/routes/*.rs` | Three forms in active use: `Json(json!({"error": ...}))`, `(StatusCode::X, msg)`, `.into_response()` with bare strings. Standardise on one — likely `(StatusCode, Json(json!({"error": ...})))`. |
| L2 | ✅ **DONE** (`6889825`) — `crate::config::resolve_model_dir(model_dir_root, model_id)` is now the single source of truth; `web::routes::ai::resolve_model_dir` is a one-line delegate; 3 inline `~/`-expansion blocks in `main.rs` removed. | `src/config.rs`, `src/web/routes/ai.rs`, `src/main.rs` | — |
| L3 | ✅ **DONE** (`6889825`) — `config::load_config()` returns `(PathBuf, CatalogConfig)`. Replaced the inline pair in **27** command handlers (initial 10+ estimate was conservative). | `src/main.rs` | — |
| L4 | All web handlers are `async fn` that immediately `spawn_blocking` | `src/web/routes/*.rs` | No real async work happens in any handler. The current shape is safe and idiomatic for axum, but the H5 helper would also tidy this up. |

## Implementation plan

Three batches. The first is small and surgical (no test impact, low risk). The second is the big-payoff structural work. The third is documentation polish that can ship anytime.

### Batch 1 — Small DRY wins ✅ DONE (`6889825`, 2026-05-03)

Cohesive, no public-API changes, no test impact. Tests stayed at 779 + 249 / 886 + 273.

1. ✅ **L3** — `config::load_config()` extracted; **27** paired call sites in `main.rs` migrated.
2. ✅ **H4** — `web::routes::resolve_asset_id_or_err` lifted; **7** sites migrated; "no asset found matching '{prefix}'" message unified.
3. ⚠️ **H5** — `web::routes::spawn_catalog_blocking` helper landed (returns `Result<T, Response>` so handlers can `?`-short-circuit). **3 demonstration sites migrated** (`volumes_page`, `assign_face`, `unassign_face`); remaining ~100 sites left for opportunistic cleanup as touched. Recount: 106 actual sites across 13 files (initial 40+ estimate was low).
4. ✅ **L2** — `crate::config::resolve_model_dir(root, model_id)` is the single source of truth; web helper delegates; 3 inline `main.rs` blocks removed.
5. ❌ **M5** — Withdrawn after re-inspection; flagged site builds `Vec<&Volume>` for sequential iteration, not a `HashMap` for lookups, so `online_map()` returns the wrong shape. Code is correct as-is.
6. ✅ **M6** — `classify_impl` → `classify_inner`. Codebase now uniformly uses `_inner` for private helpers.

Net diff: +153 / −142 LOC across 9 files.

### Batch 2 — Structural splits (separate PRs, larger)

Each item is its own PR — they're independent of each other. Order by pain-relief: `main.rs` first because every code review touches it.

1. ✅ **H1** (PARTIAL, `7ce8d11`) — extracted Import, Tag, AutoTag, RebuildCatalog, Volume; `run_command` 5921 → 4062 LOC. Remaining big arms left for opportunistic cleanup.
2. ✅ **M1** (`85984f8`) — `web/routes/ai/` directory module: tags, embed, similarity, faces, stroll.
3. ⏳ **H3** — Split `asset_service.rs` along its existing `// ═══ X ═══` section markers into `asset_service/{import,verify,sync,dedup,refresh,export,ai}.rs`. (~4–6h, more disruption because shared private helpers will need to be lifted to a module-internal `mod common` or be kept on the main impl.) Recommended approach: create the submodules as `impl AssetService { ... }` blocks across files, no struct split — Rust supports multi-file `impl`. This minimises the code churn and keeps the public API identical.
4. ⏳ **H2** — Split `catalog.rs` along the same plan as H3. (~4–6h.) Same multi-file-`impl` strategy.
5. ✅ **M2** (`9d24d8f`) — extracted the parsing layer into `query/parse.rs` (~800 LOC). The original plan suggested search/write split on the impl block; the cleaner cleavage turned out to be parsing (DB-free) vs everything else (DB-bound). Public API unchanged via `pub use parse::*;`. Search-impl/write-impl split can follow if query.rs grows again.
6. ⏳ **M3 + M4** — Further decomposition of `build_search_where` (still 356 LOC in catalog.rs) and `parse_search_query` (245 LOC, table-driven dispatch in query/parse.rs). (~2h together.)

**Afternoon scope (M1 + H1 + M2) landed 2026-05-03.** H3 and H2 should each be their own focused session per the original plan.

### Batch 3 — Documentation polish (~2h, low priority)

1. **M7** — Add `//!` module docs to all 20 source files lacking them. One or two sentences each. Mechanical pass with `Grep` for `^//!` to find gaps. (~45 min)
2. **M8** — Doc the top-three files' undocumented public items (81 total). Prioritise return types and entrypoint methods; skip trivial accessors. (~1h)
3. **M9** — Add 4–8 line purpose comments to the seven large templates. Pattern: what the template is, where it's mounted, what external JS APIs it exposes. (~30 min)
4. **L1** — Standardise web error-response shape on `(StatusCode, Json(json!({"error": ...})))`. Mostly mechanical search-and-replace. (~30 min)

This batch can land in any order; each item is independent and self-contained.

### Not addressed

- **H6** (no inline tests in `main.rs`): leaving for now. The CLI integration suite covers external behaviour, which is what matters for a CLI tool. Inline tests would mostly duplicate what `tests/cli.rs` already exercises. Revisit only if a regression slips through that an inline test would have caught.

---

## Top 5 priorities (afternoon batch)

If time-boxed to a single afternoon, the maximum-payoff sequence is:

1. **Batch 1 entirely** (~3h) — six small DRY wins, one commit, no risk.
2. **H1** (Batch 2 #1, ~2–3h) — extract main.rs command handlers; alone shrinks the most-edited file in the repo by a third or more.

Everything in Batch 1 is independent, so the afternoon doesn't need to pick a stopping point — fold in as many as time allows. H1 is one focused session.

Estimated total: 5–6h for the highest-impact ~70% of the punch-list. The remaining structural splits (H2, H3) and documentation pass (Batch 3) are best as separate sessions.
