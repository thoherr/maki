# Changelog

All notable changes to the Digital Asset Manager are documented here.

## v1.3.0

### New Features
- **Comprehensive user manual** — 21 markdown files in `doc/manual/` covering every command, filter, and configuration option, organized into User Guide (7 workflow chapters), Reference Guide (10 man-page style command docs), and Developer Guide (3 pages: REST API, module reference, build/test)
- **9 Mermaid diagrams** — ER diagrams, architecture layers, round-trip workflow, XMP sync sequence, import pipeline, auto-group algorithm, maintenance cycle, data model, and module dependency graph
- **7 web UI screenshots** — browse page, saved search chips, asset detail, batch toolbar, tags page, collections page, and catalog structure
- **README Documentation section** — links to all three guide sections

## v1.2.0

### Enhancements
- **Browse grid deduplication** — assets with multiple variants (e.g. RAW+JPEG) now appear as a single card in the browse grid instead of one card per variant. Implemented via a denormalized `best_variant_hash` column on the `assets` table, computed at write time using the same Export > Processed > Original scoring as preview selection. Search queries with no variant-level filters skip the `variants` JOIN entirely for faster queries.
- **Primary format display** — browse cards now show the asset's identity format (e.g. NEF, RAF) instead of the preview variant's format (JPG). A denormalized `primary_variant_format` column prefers Original+RAW, then Original+any, then the best variant's format.
- **Variant count badge** — browse cards show a variant count badge (e.g. "3v") when an asset has more than one variant, making multi-variant assets visible at a glance.
- **`dam serve --log`** — the global `--log` flag now enables request logging on the web server, printing `METHOD /path -> STATUS (duration)` to stderr for each HTTP request.

## v1.1.1

### Enhancements
- **`path:` filter normalization** — the `path:` search filter now accepts filesystem paths in the CLI: `~` expands to `$HOME`, `./` and `../` resolve relative to the current working directory, and absolute paths matching a registered volume's mount point are automatically stripped to volume-relative with the volume filter implicitly applied. Plain relative paths (no `./` prefix) remain volume-relative prefix matches as before.

## v1.1.0

### New Features
- **Export-based preview selection** — previews now prefer Export > Processed > Original variants for display. RAW+JPEG assets show the processed JPEG preview instead of the flat dcraw rendering. Affects `dam show`, web UI asset detail page, and `generate-previews` catalog mode.
- **`generate-previews --upgrade`** — regenerate previews for assets where a better variant (export/processed) exists than the one currently previewed. Useful after importing exports alongside existing RAW files.

## v1.0.0

First stable release. All planned features are implemented, all tests pass, documentation is complete. Ready for production use.

### Highlights

- **22 CLI commands** covering the full asset management lifecycle: import, search, browse, edit, group, relocate, verify, sync, refresh, cleanup, and more
- **Web UI** with search, filtering, inline editing, batch operations, keyboard navigation, saved searches, and collections
- **Bidirectional XMP sync** with CaptureOne, Lightroom, and other photo editing tools
- **Content-addressable storage** with SHA-256 deduplication and integrity verification across multiple offline volumes
- **Stem-based auto-grouping** for RAW+JPEG+sidecar bundles, with fuzzy cross-directory grouping for exports

### Changes since v0.7.1

- Add 10 integration tests (group, fix-roles, refresh, edit --label)
- Complete documentation: architecture overview, component specification, specification
- Move specification into doc/ directory

## v0.7.1

### New Features
- **`dam fix-roles` command** — scan multi-variant assets and re-role non-RAW variants from Original to Export when a RAW variant exists. Fixes assets imported before the auto-grouping role fix. Dry-run by default (`--apply` to execute). Supports `--volume`, `--asset`, `--json`, `--log`, `--time`.
- **Import auto-grouping role fix** — newly imported RAW+non-RAW pairs now correctly assign Export role to non-RAW variants (previously both were marked Original)

## v0.7.0

### New Features
- **`dam auto-group` command** — automatically group assets by filename stem across directories, solving the problem where CaptureOne exports land in different directories than their RAW originals. Uses fuzzy prefix + separator matching (e.g., `Z91_8561.ARW` matches `Z91_8561-1-HighRes-(c)_2025_Thomas Herrmann.tif`). Chain resolution ensures multiple export levels all group to the shortest root stem. RAW files are preferred as the group target; donors are re-roled from Original to Export. Dry-run by default (`--apply` to execute). Supports `--json`, `--log`, `--time`.
- **"Group by name" batch button** in web UI — select assets on the browse page and click "Group by name" to auto-group them by filename stem with a confirmation dialog

### Bug Fixes
- **`group` now preserves recipes** — merging donor assets into a target now copies recipe records, preventing recipe loss on `rebuild-catalog`
- **`group` re-roles donor variants** — donor variants with role "original" are changed to "export" in both sidecar YAML and SQLite catalog, correctly reflecting their derived status

## v0.6.4

### Improvements
- **Auto-search on all filter changes** — removed the explicit Search button; text inputs (query, path) auto-search with 300ms debounce, dropdowns (type, format, volume, collection) trigger immediately on change, matching the existing behavior of stars, labels, and tags

## v0.6.3

### New Features
- **`path:` search filter** — filter assets by file location path prefix (e.g., `path:Capture/2026-02-22`), with quoted value support for paths with spaces; works in CLI, web UI (dedicated input in filter row), and saved searches
- **Grouped `--help` output** — CLI help now groups commands logically (Core, Organization, Maintenance, Output) for easier discovery

## v0.6.2

### New Features
- **Collection filter dropdown** in browse page filter row — collections are now composable with all other search filters (tag, rating, type, format, volume) directly from the browse page
- Batch toolbar collection buttons now sync from the filter-row dropdown instead of URL params

## v0.6.1

### New Features
- **Collection removal** from web UI — asset detail page shows collection membership chips with × remove buttons
- **Collection creation** from web UI — `/collections` page with "+ New Collection" button

## v0.6.0

### New Features
- **Saved searches** (smart albums) — `dam saved-search` (alias `ss`) with save, list, run, delete subcommands; stored in `searches.toml`; web UI chips on browse page with rename/delete on hover
- **Collections** (static albums) — `dam collection` (alias `col`) with create, list, show, add, remove, delete subcommands; SQLite-backed with YAML persistence; search filter `collection:<name>`; web UI batch toolbar integration
- **Quoted filter values** — search parser supports double-quoted values for multi-word filters (`tag:"Fools Theater"`, `collection:"My Favorites"`)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix saved search chip hover showing rename/delete buttons incorrectly

## v0.5.1

### New Features
- **Import `--dry-run` flag** — preview what an import would do without writing to catalog, sidecar, or disk
- **Inline name editing** in web UI — pencil icon toggle, text input with Save/Cancel

## v0.5.0

### New Features
- **Keyboard navigation** on browse page — arrow keys navigate cards (column-aware), Enter opens detail, Space toggles selection, 1–5/0 set/clear rating, Alt+1–7/0 set/clear color label, letter keys r/o/y/g/b/p/u/x for quick label

## v0.4.5

### New Features
- **`dam refresh` command** — re-read metadata from changed sidecar/recipe files without full re-import; supports `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--log`, `--time`

## v0.4.4

### New Features
- **Color labels** — first-class 7-color label support (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Pink, Purple); XMP `xmp:Label` extraction, CLI editing (`dam edit --label`), web UI color dot picker, browse filtering, batch operations, XMP write-back
- **Batch operations** in web UI — multi-select checkboxes, fixed bottom toolbar with tag add/remove, rating stars, color label dots

### Bug Fixes
- Fix Ctrl+A not working after checkbox click
- Remove unreliable shift-click range selection, replace with Cmd/Ctrl+A

- **Inline description editing** in web UI — pencil icon toggle, textarea with Save/Cancel

## v0.4.2

### New Features
