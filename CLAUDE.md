# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A digital asset manager designed for large collections of images and videos (terabytes across multiple offline storage devices). Key design goals:

- Content-addressable storage for originals (SHA-based, since originals like RAW files are immutable)
- Text-based metadata in sidecar files
- Grouping of asset variants (RAW/JPEG, different processing versions)
- Deduplication of identical files
- Transparent file relocation across storage devices
- Management of processing recipes (CaptureOne, Photoshop, etc.)
- Location-independent navigation and retrieval

## Technology

- **Language**: Rust
- **Platforms**: macOS, Linux
- **Interface**: CLI-first (`dam` command), optional web GUI
- **Catalog**: SQLite (cache/index), YAML sidecar files (source of truth)
- **Key crates**: clap, sha2, serde, rusqlite, axum, kamadak-exif, image
- **External tools**: dcraw/libraw (RAW previews), ffmpeg (video thumbnails)

## Architecture

See `doc/architecture-overview.md` for the high-level system design and `doc/component-specification.md` for detailed component specs.

Core layers: CLI → Core Library (Asset Service, Content Store, Metadata Store, Device Registry, Query Engine, Preview Generator) → Storage (Local Catalog + Media Volumes).

## Status

Core CLI is functional. See `specification.md` for full requirements.

**Implemented commands**: `init`, `volume add/list`, `import`, `search`, `show`, `tag`, `group`, `rebuild-catalog`

**Import behavior**: When importing a file whose content already exists (same SHA-256), the import adds the new file location to the existing variant rather than silently skipping. This tracks where identical content lives across the filesystem. Only truly skips when the exact same location (volume + path) is already recorded.

**Not yet implemented**: `relocate`, `verify`, `duplicates`
